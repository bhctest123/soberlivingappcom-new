## Who is responsible for certifying sober living homes in New Hampshire?

The [New Hampshire Coalition of Recovery Residences](https://www.nhcorr.org/), also known as NHCORR, represents the National Alliance for Recovery Residences, or [NARR](https://narronline.org/),  in New Hampshire. NHCORR is a non-profit, and unaffiliated with the state government, but state laws require sober living homes to complete the NHCORR certification process before they are allowed to apply for entry into the state’s voluntary registry for sober living homes. 

## Is certification or registration required for New Hampshire sober living homes? 

![sober living home voluntary registry regulation new hampshire how to register](/images/blog/opening-a-sober-living-home-in-new-hampshire/Screen_Shot_2023-01-24_at_5.26.44_PM.png)

Yes and no. You may operate a sober living home in New Hampshire without certification or registration. You’ll still need to meet all relevant requirements for single family homes, such as fire code rules and zoning regulations. You’ll also need to obtain a business license if your home is operated as a business, of course. However, there is no blanket requirement that all homes must be certified in order to open their doors in New Hampshire. 

That said, you will lose out on some benefits by not choosing to certify and register your home. One of the key benefits of getting certified with NHCORR and applying to be added to the New Hampshire Voluntary Registry in New Hampshire is that certified and registered homes are the only homes that are eligible for referrals from state agencies. This includes referrals from the parole board and various kinds of social state social workers. This also includes referrals from any state funded recovery program. For some business models, this is an acceptable loss, for others it’s not.

You can review the state laws that govern the voluntary registration of New Hampshire sober living homes in [Part He-A 305 of the New Hampshire Administrative Code](https://casetext.com/regulation/new-hampshire-administrative-code/title-he-department-of-health-and-human-services/subtitle-he-a-former-office-of-alcohol-drug-abuse-prevention/chapter-he-a-300-certification-and-operation-of-alcohol-and-other-drug-disorder-treatment-programs/part-he-a-305-voluntary-registry-for-recovery-houses). 

## What is the process like for getting my sober living home certified in New Hampshire? 

![NHCORR new hampshire sober living home application certification log in](/images/blog/opening-a-sober-living-home-in-new-hampshire/Screen_Shot_2023-01-24_at_5.28.00_PM.png)

NHCORR’s certification application portal is hosted on [Certemy](https://bit.ly/3sNL4qO). You must pay a $275 application fee and allow an informal first visit - known as an “informal introductory visit” - to your home. Next, you upload documents to the application portal and complete a formal “verification visit” as well as a “formal interview with house leadership.” Certification, if granted at that point, is good for one year. 

## What is the difference between sober living home certification and sober living home registration in New Hampshire? 

![new hampshire DHHS health and human services sober living home registration list](/images/blog/opening-a-sober-living-home-in-new-hampshire/Screen_Shot_2023-01-24_at_5.29.55_PM.png)

In New Hampshire, your sober living home can be: 

  * Uncertified 

  * Certified 

Or 

  * Certified and registered 

Certification of sober living homes is completed by NHCORR. After certification is complete, sober living home operators can also opt to apply for entry into the [New Hampshire Voluntary Recovery House Registry](https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/documents2/nhvregistry.pdf), maintained by the [New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/). Entry into the voluntary registry is what makes sober living homes eligible for state referrals. Only homes that have gone through the NHCORR certification process are eligible to apply for entry into the Voluntary Recovery House Registry.

## What are the benefits of seeking certification in New Hampshire for sober living homes? 

![new hampshire sober living home voluntary house registry certification](/images/blog/opening-a-sober-living-home-in-new-hampshire/Screen_Shot_2023-01-24_at_5.14.06_PM.png)

There are many benefits to getting your sober living home certified with HNCORR. Receipt of referrals from state agencies and state-affiliated agencies is one of the biggest benefits, but there are others as well. They include: 

  * Free advertising on the NHCORR website 

  * Free advocacy and policy influence from NHCORR’s efforts with zoning laws, municipal outreach and various government committee meetings 

  * Free training and members-only educational and networking events 

  * Access to camaraderie and networking with fellow sober living home operators 

  * Assistance with managing and mediating complaints and NIMBY concerns 

## How much does it cost to get my sober living home certified in New Hampshire? 

New Hampshire’s certification costs, by way of NHCORR, are relatively low. For one, there is only a single fee: an application fee. Other states and organizations levy not only application fees, but sometimes also apply inspection fees, renewal fees, “per bed” fees, and other additional charges to the total certification bill. In New Hampshire, you can certify your sober living home for only $275 total. The certification is good for one year.

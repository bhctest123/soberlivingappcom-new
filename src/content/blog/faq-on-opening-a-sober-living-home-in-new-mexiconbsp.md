## What is the best place to open a sober living home in New Mexico?

Some areas of New Mexico are more affected by SUD than others. For example, [Rio Arriba and Bernalillo County rank as the top two “hot spots”](https://www.nmlegis.gov/Entity/LFC/Documents/Health_Notes/Health%20Notes%20-%20Status%20of%20Substance%20Abuse%20Treatment%20and%20Outcomes,%20November%202019.pdf) for overdose death rates in the state. Likewise, some demographics are more affected by SUD than others in New Mexico. 

## What are the best populations to target with new sober living homes in New Mexico?

![recovery housing program grants sober living home new mexico funding](/images/blog/faq-on-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-new-mexiconbsp/Screen_Shot_2023-01-09_at_10.15.24_AM.png)

According to recent studies, [young Hispanic men in New Mexico](https://www.nmhealth.org/data/view/substance/1862/) suffer an overdose death rate that exceeds the fatalities seen in any other population. Understanding the areas and populations of greatest need in New Mexico can assist operators in developing business plans that are tailored to the existing demand in the state.

There have been reports that disreputable patient brokers have [attempted to specifically exploit the large Native American population in New Mexico](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2022/12/17/arizona-rehab-center-scams-targeting-indigenous-people-advocates-say/69726049007/), particularly people with SUD in the Navajo Nation, which straddles the border of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Rather than create legitimate culturally responsive recovery housing for this population, these bad actors bribe vulnerable residents of tribal communities into non medical transport vans and bring them to poorly managed homes in cities like Phoenix, delivering subpar services in exchange for generous insurance compensation. Clearly, this is a business model to avoid when planning recovery residences in New Mexico. 

## Do sober living homes need to be licensed or certified in New Mexico? What regulations apply?

![new mexico has no regulations for sober living homes recovery residences halfway houses](/images/blog/faq-on-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-new-mexiconbsp/Screen_Shot_2023-01-10_at_3.56.16_PM.png)

According to The Mental Health & Addiction Certification Board of Oregon’s [National Overview of Recovery Housing Accreditation Legislation and Licensing](https://mhacbo.org/media/NATIONAL.OVERVIEW.RECOVERY.HOUSING.January.2020.pdf), there is “no current private or state accreditation and none under development” for sober living homes in New Mexico. 

## Are sober living homes allowed in residential areas in New Mexico?

Yes. In 2019, Brennan Williams, Planning and Zoning Director for the City of Albuquerque, told [KRQE news](https://www.krqe.com/news/investigations/albuquerque-sober-living-house-sparks-regulation-questions/) the following: “...[G]roup homes are not allowed in residential zones, whereas community residential facilities, similar to group homes but different — are allowed.” Sober living homes are considered community residential facilities in the United States and in New Mexico in particular. They are protected by ADA and FHA standards, which say that people with disabilities like SUD may not be discriminated against when it comes to housing. 

## Are addiction treatment centers and sober living homes subject to the same regulations in New Mexico?

![sober living homes are not considered health facilities in New Mexico](/images/blog/faq-on-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-new-mexiconbsp/Screen_Shot_2023-01-10_at_3.57.02_PM.png)

No. Unlike sober living homes, addiction treatment centers are managed and licensed by the state of New Mexico under the larger umbrella term, “health facility.” New Mexico places all addiction treatment centers - what they term “[alcohol and drug abuse hospitals](https://behavehealth.com/blog/2022/3/17/opening-an-addiction-treatment-center-in-new-mexico-heres-what-you-need-to-know-nbsp)” - in the same bucket at freestanding birth centers and nursing homes. All of these “health facilities” must [maintain a license with the state](https://www.nmhealth.org/about/dhi/hflc/prop/stli/). 

## What grants exist for sober living home development in New Mexico?

![recovery housing program notice of funding availability housing new mexico sober living home grants](/images/blog/faq-on-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-new-mexiconbsp/Screen_Shot_2023-01-10_at_3.57.25_PM.png)

Housing [New Mexico’s Recovery Housing Program](https://housingnm.org/resources/2022-recovery-housing-program) (RHP) offered funding opportunities for privately and publicly owned non-profit organizations dedicated to housing individuals with SUD through the 2022 fiscal year. Because New Mexico was [identified as one of the 24 states](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/rhp/rhp-overview/) in the US with overdose mortality rate above the national average, RHP funding could be used to purchase and/or improve real estate for the purposes of sober living home development in New Mexico. Although the program has concluded, it makes sense to watch the MFA website to see if new funding opportunities pop up for sober living homes in the future. 

## Where can I find the National Association of Recovery Residences (NARR) affiliate in New Mexico?

![National Association for Recovery Residences sober living home new mexico no state affiliate](/images/blog/faq-on-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-new-mexiconbsp/Screen_Shot_2023-01-09_at_10.13.47_AM.png)

New Mexico does not currently have a NARR affiliate. The [NARR website](https://narronline.org/) does not list any affiliate in the state, nor does it note that any affiliate is in development. This may soon change as more and more states open NARR affiliates.

MASH certification is a rigorous process designed to ensure that sober homes meet high standards of safety and effectiveness:

## Effects on Patients

For individuals recovering from substance use disorders (SUD), access to certified sober homes can be life-changing. These residences provide a structured environment where residents can focus on their recovery while receiving peer support.

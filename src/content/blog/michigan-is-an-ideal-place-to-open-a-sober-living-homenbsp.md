Sober living homes are on the rise in Michigan. According to the [Michigan Association of Recovery Residences](<https://michiganarr.com/statistics>), there were 460 certified recovery home beds in 2018 and over 2258 certified sober living home beds in the state in 2022. Likewise, the state had only 16 certified operators in 2018 and 62 separate certified operators managing a total of 270 residences in 2022. 

This makes sense because over [10% of Michiganders use illegal drugs every month](<https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/0,5885,7-339-71548_54783_54784_57850---,00.html>), and 27% engage in binge drinking in any given month of the year. [Drug overdoses have ballooned 82%](<https://www.alltreatment.com/michigan-drug-statistics-and-trends/>) in the state over the course of the pandemic. 

Michigan is a great state for sober living home business start ups and expansions. The state has a huge need for sober living homes, as well as low levels of regulation which makes it easier and more lucrative to operate in the state. 

## Your Sober Living Home May Face NIMBYism and Local Regulations in Michigan

While there are no requirements for licensure at the state level in Michigan at this time for sober living homes, would-be operators do face other challenges and obstacles. 

One of those challenges in NIMBYism. Anticipate some community push-back as you explore locations for your sober living facility. The [opposition the Amber Reinck House experienced in Proctor, Michigan](<https://www.livingstondaily.com/story/news/2020/01/30/amber-reineck-house-lawsuit-howell-sober-living-home-women-fair-housing-center-southeast-midmichigan/2856470001/>) is a great example of the type of reaction you may encounter in Michigan. 

You may also face regulations at the local level, as [four sober living homes in the Village of Milford](<https://www.theoaklandpress.com/2018/05/09/milford-planning-commission-discusses-regulation-of-sober-living-homes/>) are beginning to experience. 

## Sober Living Homes in Michigan Are Not Required to Get Licensed by the State

While sober living homes in the state of Michigan may contract with county public mental health systems as service providers, they are not required to be licensed or regulated by the state. Addiction treatment centers in Michigan must get licensed with the [Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs](<https://www.michigan.gov/lara>), also known as LARA, but sober living homes that do not offer treatment of any kind are exempt from these requirements. 

Like every other state in the US, Michigan protects sober living homes under anti-discrimination and fair housing laws, like those outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act, which maintain that no one may be discriminated against based on a health diagnosis. 

## Consider Getting Certified by the Michigan Association of Recovery Residences

MARR (aka the [Michigan Association of Recovery Residences, Inc](<https://michiganarr.com/>)) is a National Association of Recovery Residences affiliate that represents 270 certified recovery residences in the state. MARR certifies four different levels of sober living homes according to NARR standards and conducts a site review as part of the review process. They offer [courses and statewide trainings](<https://michiganarr.com/news>) for sober living home operators in the state in advance of certification as well as [Best Practices Summits](<https://mailchi.mp/narronline/save-the-date-2021-narr-summit?fbclid=IwAR1dti0cdoEFkS-3qeFWwULjriSavoBnCen1bNzvSPEN3mWm0jM03gAre7g>) and other professional development opportunities for the recovery community.

If you’re opening a sober living home in Michigan, you should definitely consider [getting certified by MARR](<https://michiganarr.com/become-certified>). Certification can help ease NIMBY resistance for your residence and establish your home as an ethical, professional organization. 

The initial MARR certification application fee is $300 plus another $300 per sober living home residence. There is a $100 annual inspection fee due every year to keep your certification current.

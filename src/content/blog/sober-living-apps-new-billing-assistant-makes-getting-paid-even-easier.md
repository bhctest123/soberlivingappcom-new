It’s probably safe to say that collecting payments at your sober living home isn’t your favorite part of the job. Few people get into sober living home management for the pleasure of collecting rent. 

But every month, [COVID-19](../../4/21/3-coronavirus-changes-your-sober-living-home-needs-to-make-this-week.html) or no, it needs to be done. 

At [Sober Living App](../../../../index.html), we’re excited to announce some new tools we’ve added to our [Summer 2020 update](https://info.behavehealth.com/en/behave-health-summer-2020-update) that are designed to make getting paid as easy as possible - every time.

## Sober Living Homes Often Collect Payments in a Disorganized Way

![Disorganized payment collection costs sober living homes time and money.](/images/blog/sober-living-apps-new-billing-assistant-makes-getting-paid-even-easier/Screenshot_2020-10-01_at_1.03.50_PM.png)

Many sober living homes collect rent haphazardly. Your [sober living home manager](../../8/5/5-things-your-sober-living-home-manager-is-afraid-to-tell-you.html) might set up a box to collect checks, maintaining a spreadsheet to track who’s paid and who still needs to chip in. That’s sober living home bill collection at its most basic.

The pitfalls in this system are obvious:

  * It takes a lot of time to personally remind residents of the payment due date 

  * More time is wasted on reminding late payers to settle their accounts 

  * It’s logistically complicated for multiple payers to chip in on a single account 

  * It’s easy to lose track of who’s paid and who hasn’t

  * Physical checks and cash are time consuming to process  

There’s a better way.

## Here’s The Changes We’ve Made to the Make Sober Living Home Billing Easier

At Sober Living App, we’ve always made it easy for sober living homes to collect payments online. Residents have always been able to view bills and make payments on their phone using the resident portal. Our easy cloud-based application allows [new residents](https://soberlivingapp.com/sober-living-app-blog/2020/3/17/mastering-admissions-at-your-sober-living-home) to make move-in payments as they are completing the [intake paperwork on their phone](https://soberlivingapp.com/sober-living-app-blog/2020/6/30/heres-what-you-need-to-start-including-in-your-sober-living-home-resident-agreements). 

It was a good start. 

But for our 2020 Summer Update, we’ve made [a few key changes](../../9/22/chaotic-admissions-and-billing-check-out-sober-living-apps-admissions-20-update.html) to really kick your billing efforts into high gear. 

Read on to learn more about how these tools and features will help keep your sober living home profitable with less time and effort. 

## Our Click Through Services Book Make it a Snap to Collect Sober Living Home Rent 

![Sober Living App’s service book feature helps you save time.](/images/blog/sober-living-apps-new-billing-assistant-makes-getting-paid-even-easier/Screenshot_2020-10-01_at_11.59.46_AM.jpg)

Our new Services Book makes it easy to create a prefab “menu” of services your sober living home offers with built-in pricing. Simply choose the service, the date and the resident and the bill completes itself. 

Write a title and description of the service, along with the price, and set the billing cycle as monthly, bi-monthly, weekly or daily. You can assign the service to a particular property, as well. 

For example, if you offer weekly massages at two different properties at two different price points, you can easily set that up in the services book in order to avoid confusion and ensure consistent pricing within each property. We take care of the rest.

## Easy Automated Repeating Charges Take the Pressure Off Your Sober Living Home Manager

If you run a sober living home, then you have repeating charges. Rent, storage space, amenities: these all take place on a repeating basis. 

Our automated repeating charges feature make payment collection truly “set and forget.” Sit back and watch our repeating charges feature generate bills (and send reminders!) at whatever frequency works for your sober living home. It’s that easy.  

## Our Updated Billing Assistant Gives Your Sober Living Home the Ability to Seamlessly Collect from Multiple Payers

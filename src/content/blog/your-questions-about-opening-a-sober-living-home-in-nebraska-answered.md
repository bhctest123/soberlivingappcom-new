## What is one of the biggest challenges for the sober living community in Nebraska? 

By far one of the biggest challenges is the lack of service providers, particularly in rural areas. Over [85% of counties](https://www.3newsnow.com/news/national/two-americas/rural-communities-lack-treatment-options-for-substance-use-disorders) in the state have been recognized as “Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas.” The same goes for sober living homes in Nebraska. There are many homes in the Omaha and Lincoln area, but as you move outside the metro area, there are very few sober living homes, halfway houses, or recovery residences. 

There is a very high demand for sober living in Nebraska and not enough homes to meet that demand, making the state an ideal place to open a new sober living facility. 

## Do sober living homes in Nebraska face neighborhood opposition? 

![NIMBY sober living home nebraska complaints ADA FHA regulations](/images/blog/your-questions-about-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-nebraska-answered/Screen_Shot_2023-01-10_at_4.00.28_PM.png)

Yes. 

Like many states, Nebraska is home to a fair amount of NIMBY opposition. For example, one Oxford home in Lincoln, Nebraska [received complaints from neighbors](https://journalstar.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/opponents-score-victory-in-complaints-over-sober-living-house-in-lincoln-with-14-residents/article_136d9e3e-f897-5538-a3e3-47049e0a5a2c.html). One of the main objections? The fact that 15 men were sharing a 5 bedroom, 2 bathroom home. In reality, NIMBY opposition to sober living homes is common. They frequently center around zoning concerns and worries about property value, as well as practical matters such as parking and littering squabbles. 

Nevertheless, sober living homes in Nebraska are nationally protected by ADA and FHA laws, which guarantee that people with disabilities (like SUD) have equal access to basic rights, such as housing. 

## Are sober living homes, transitional housing facilities, halfway houses, recovery residences and other residential programs for people with SUD required to seek certification or licensing in Nebraska?

![certification is optional for sober living homes in nebraska](/images/blog/your-questions-about-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-nebraska-answered/Screen_Shot_2023-01-10_at_6.05.36_PM.png)

No, sober living homes are not required to seek certification by the government in Nebraska, as there is no such program in the state. Addiction treatment centers, however, are required to be licensed in Nebraska. According to the [Department of Health and Human Services in Nebraska](https://dhhs.ne.gov/licensure/Pages/Mental-Health-Substance-Use-Treatment-Centers.aspx), sober living homes are exempt from rules around “Mental Health and Substance Use Treatment Centers” because they don’t “provide minimum supervision of client’s personal care, activities of daily living or health maintenance of clients.” Activities of daily living, also called “ADLs,” are typical of the types of services offered in nursing homes: help with eating, bathing, etc. Sober living homes don’t offer this type of help, nor do they offer medical treatment or SUD treatment. In that sense, they are considered “self-run programs,” which are exempt from licensure requirements in Nebraska. 

## Is there any central oversight, regulatory body or association for sober living homes in Nebraska? 

![regulations sober living home Nebraska certification](/images/blog/your-questions-about-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-nebraska-answered/Screen_Shot_2023-01-10_at_4.01.17_PM.png)

No, not at this time. 

The [Omaha World-Herald reported](https://omaha.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/no-licensing-little-oversight-omaha-owner-of-homes-for-sex-offenders-faces-his-own-charge/article_24f2084c-1e6e-11ed-9206-6f312de4bffa.html) that Nebraska’s prison inspector general, Doug Moebernick, stated in a recent study of sober living in the state that “..there is no central regulatory or oversight authority for these homes.” Though he estimated that there are 100 or 200 sober living homes in the state in the report, he was unable to say precisely how many recovery residences are in operation in Nebraska for lack of centralized records.

## Have there been any efforts to regulate sober living homes in Nebraska? Is there any pending legislation that would make certification or licensing mandatory? 

![sober living home nebraska recovery residence laws oversight regulation bill legislation](/images/blog/your-questions-about-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-nebraska-answered/Screen_Shot_2023-01-10_at_4.29.17_PM.png)

There have been efforts in the past to bring regulation to sober living in Nebraska.  State Sen Terrekk McKinney of Omaha [introduced a bill](https://omaha.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/no-licensing-little-oversight-omaha-owner-of-homes-for-sex-offenders-faces-his-own-charge/article_24f2084c-1e6e-11ed-9206-6f312de4bffa.html) that would have required licensing of halfway houses in Nebraska, but that bill failed to become law. 

According to a [study](https://mhacbo.org/media/NATIONAL.OVERVIEW.RECOVERY.HOUSING.January.2020.pdf) compiled by The Mental Health & Addiction Certification Board of Oregon, there is no additional pending legislation that might make certification required for sober living homes in Nebraska.  

## Does Nebraska have a NARR affiliate? Is there any organization or association for sober living homes in Nebraska? 

No, there is no third party advocacy organization for the sober living home community in Nebraska. According to the [NARR website](https://narronline.org/), there is no affiliate chapter in development in the state. However, as more states organize committees to study potential regulation of the industry, there has been an increase in the development of NARR affiliates throughout the nation. This trend may well extend to Nebraska in the future.

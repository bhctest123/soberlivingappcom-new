## Opening a sober living home is a complicated undertaking. A startup consultant makes it simple.

Sober living is an exciting market to get involved in, but it can also be a complicated undertaking. Between NIMBY interference, rapidly changing regulations at the local, state, and federal regulations, startup capital concerns, business plan decisions, and more, there are plenty of pitfalls that lay in wait for entrepreneurs who don’t know what they don’t know. 

At first glance, sober living is simple: secure a location, install a house management system, and do a little marketing. 

The truth of the matter is a bit more involved.

## Sober living startup consultants sort through the noise to develop a winning business plan tailored to your location, market, and goals

Most entrepreneurs are self-directed self-starters, and we’ve found that to be especially true in the sober living space. Often, owner-operators have personal experience in the recovery industry, whether that’s as a patient, a provider, or as a patient advocate of some kind. The vast majority of people who are drawn to this space are passionate about transforming lives and continuing the ongoing fight against addiction. 

No matter where you fall in that continuum, what you bring to the table is valuable. 

It’s rare that we engage with a sober living home operator who needs help with generating passion or appreciating the “big vision” of this industry. In all likelihood, you already understand how valuable and urgent this work is and how important it is that we maintain an impeccable standard of excellence in this industry. 

It’s likely, too, that while you’re very enthusiastic about getting started, you’re probably also feeling overwhelmed by all of the details that go into sober living home startups. If that describes you, then you’re in good company. We often collaborate with aspiring sober living home operators who need help with the nitty-gritty details of the business. 

## Feel confident about your sober living home startup from the beginning with experienced consultants

The horror stories of sober living home startups are enough to drive even the most intrepid entrepreneurs away from this industry. And while it is true that some owners have failed spectacularly - and that sober living is not a risk-free or low-risk industry - it’s also true that many, many operators enjoy thriving, growing businesses in this space. 

We work closely with thriving sober living businesses in every state in the nation.

Experience the confidence of knowing that your startup is receiving support and guidance from consultants who understand this business inside and out.

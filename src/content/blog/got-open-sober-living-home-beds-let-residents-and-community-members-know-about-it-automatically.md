![Bed management is vital to a profitable sober living home business. Advertising open beds isn’t always in the budget - until now. Introducing the bed availability widget from Sober Living App.](/images/blog/got-open-sober-living-home-beds-let-residents-and-community-members-know-about-it-automatically/Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_7.58.35_AM.png)

How are you letting referral partners, community members and potential residents know when you have open beds at your sober living home? 

Are you: 

  * Manually sending emails to your wait list? 

  * Taking the time to put in calls to local organizations?

  * Informally [tipping off some of your favorite alumni](https://soberlivingapp.com/sober-living-app-blog/2020/6/16/how-to-turn-alumni-recovery-success-into-new-residents-for-your-sober-living-home) that there might be a spot for their sponsees?

Or worse…

  * Doing nothing? 

Regardless of how you handle bed availabilities, every open bed is an opportunity to build your brand and your business.

Bed availability is a piece of good news — for the community, at least — and it should be news that you are sharing widely if you want to optimize [admissions](../../../../admission.html) at your sober living home. 

## Sober Living App’s New Bed Availability Widget Advertises Open Beds For You Effortlessly

![If you’ve got open beds at your sober living home, let people know with the bed availability widget, powered by Behave Health.](/images/blog/got-open-sober-living-home-beds-let-residents-and-community-members-know-about-it-automatically/Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_7.58.49_AM.png)

The truth is, sober living home operators like you don’t always have the time or the budget to advertise every open bed. It’s not a practical option.

Until now, that is. 

At [Sober Living App](/), we are dedicated to helping sober living home operators help as many people as possible. That’s why we’ve automated the process for you. 

With a [Sober Living App account](https://apps.behavehealth.com/signup), you can get up-to-the-minute bed availability posted to your website without adding to you or your sober living home managers’ already [mile-long to-do list](../../../2020/8/5/5-things-your-sober-living-home-manager-is-afraid-to-tell-you.html).

That’s right. 

Your new resident simply fills out your online application, you finish the admission in one simple series of click-throughs and your all-in-one sober living home software updates your bed information in the bed availability widget. 

Voila! 

The bed availability widget shows the admission and knocks down the number of available beds on your website.

## Sober Living App’s Bed Availability Widget is Easy to Install on Any Website

![The bed availability widget is easy to install on any website with a simple copy and paste job. Automatically display bed information on any website.](/images/blog/got-open-sober-living-home-beds-let-residents-and-community-members-know-about-it-automatically/Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_7.59.06_AM.png)

Installing the widget is easy. Simply copy and paste the code to embed the widget into any website, including Sqaurespace and Wordpress websites. There is no coding or complicated HTML involved. 

If you don’t know how to embed code into your website, don’t stress — your web developer can handle it in a few minutes. 

Once the code is pasted into your website, the widget automatically updates the numbers as you complete check-ins and check-outs.

## Sober Living App’s Bed Availability Widget is Completely Customizable

![Customize the bed availability widget to work for your sober living home’s bed profile. You control how much bed availability information to share.](/images/blog/got-open-sober-living-home-beds-let-residents-and-community-members-know-about-it-automatically/Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_7.59.16_AM.png)

With the Sober Living App bed availability widget, you control how much information you want to share. 

Don’t want to show the number of open beds? 

No problem. 

Want to skip the gender-specific information? 

Can do. 

You also control the button text and link on the bed availability widget. You can point the CTA (“call to action”) button to your online application form, your website or your phone number. 

The choice is yours. 

## The Bed Availability Widget is Just One of Many Bed Management Tools We Have for Sober Living Homes 

![At Sober Living App, we have a host of bed management tools for sober living home operators like you to track check-in and check-out times so you can leverage openings during the admissions process and minimize inefficient scheduling errors.](/images/blog/got-open-sober-living-home-beds-let-residents-and-community-members-know-about-it-automatically/Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_7.59.24_AM.png)

The bed availability widget helps keep the general public informed about bed availability at your sober living home, but our [staff-facing bed management tools](../../../../housing.html) offer functionality for behind-the-scenes bed management, too. 

With our calendar feature, you can easily visualize your sober living home’s bed availability. 

Chart check-in and check-out dates to quickly capture an accurate picture of your short-term and long-term resident landscape. 

Easily spot awkward “holes” in your bed availability and avoid inefficient, expensive scheduling errors before they become a problem.

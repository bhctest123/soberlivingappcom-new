Sober Living App will be at the [National Association of Recovery Residences 2023 “Best Practices Summit” in Dearborn Michigan](https://events.narronline.org/2023/3190580) from October 9th to 11th! 

We would absolutely love to see you there. Please swing by our table and get to know our Founder/CEO, Ben Weiss. We’d be happy to show you some of our best “secret weapons” for turning sober living chaos into sober living order, starting with [Sober Living App](/). 

## Here’s a Few of the Most Exciting Events on the 2023 NARR Conference Agenda for Sober Living Home Operators, Recovery Residence Researchers, and More

This year’s lineup of speakers and events is unparalleled. You’d be hard-pressed to find content like this anywhere else. The value of the agenda alone is worth the price of admission several times over. 

Consider agenda items like: 

  * [Equitable Pathways to Recovery and the People Who Use Them](https://events.narronline.org/2023/session/1769848/equitable-pathways-to-recovery-and-the-people-who-use-them)

  * [Experienced Recovery Residence Operators Panel](https://events.narronline.org/2023/session/1737538/experienced-recovery-residence-operators-panel)

  * [Building a Statewide Network and Recovery Ecosystem through Community Based Participatory Research](https://events.narronline.org/2023/session/1663235/building-a-statewide-network-and-recovery-ecosystem-through-community-based-participatory-research)

  * [Overview of Sober Home and Recovery Residence Fraud Enforcement Efforts.](https://events.narronline.org/2023/session/1663682/overview-of-sober-home-and-recovery-residence-fraud-enforcement-efforts.)

  * [How your state can successfully fund its NARR Affiliate](https://events.narronline.org/2023/session/1752392/how-your-state-can-successfully-fund-its-narr-affiliate)

![NARR 2023 conference recovery residence sober living home agenda](/images/blog/join-sober-living-app-at-the-2023-narr-conference-in-deerborn-michigan-oct-9th-11th/Screen_Shot_2023-10-05_at_8.52.35_PM.png)

  * The Intersections of Human Trafficking and Recovery Housing II

  * [Mapping the gap: Leveraging data to build effective recovery housing infrastructure](https://events.narronline.org/2023/session/1677747/mapping-the-gap-leveraging-data-to-build-effective-recovery-housing-infrastructure)

  * [Collaboration with Towns for Reduction of NIMBY Issues](https://events.narronline.org/2023/session/1617293/collaboration-with-towns-for-reduction-of-nimby-issues)

  * [Forming a Sister Organization Relationship for the Mutual Benefit of Two Residence Operators](https://events.narronline.org/2023/session/1769850/forming-a-sister-organization-relationship-for-the-mutual-benefit-of-two-residence-operators)

  * [Creating and Organizing Better Recovery Spaces for Indigenous and Islamic Communities](https://events.narronline.org/2023/session/1752391/creating-and-organizing-better-recovery-spaces-for-indigenous-and-islamic-communities)

This is far from the usual repetitive behavioral health conference fare that too many annual conferences rely on to “fluff” out their agendas. Sometimes it seems if you’ve been to one behavioral health conference, you’ve been to them all. 

However, the agenda for Dearborn has got our staff at Sober Living App actually excited to make the trip! 

There are so many experts, top researchers, and experienced sober living home operators on this agenda addressing some of the most pressing real-life issues that operators are facing day in and day out. We’re looking forward to gleaning some wisdom and new insights from this promising lineup. 

## Sober Living App isn’t Just for Sober Living Home Operators - if You’re at Dearborn, We Probably Want to Talk to You!

![sober living home NARR conference recovery residence networking 2023 software EHR EMR](/images/blog/join-sober-living-app-at-the-2023-narr-conference-in-deerborn-michigan-oct-9th-11th/Screen_Shot_2023-10-06_at_11.20.07_AM.png)

We’re passionate about patient-centered, data-driven care for the entire behavioral health continuum of care. 

While Sober Living App’s primary focus is designing and delivering smart software solutions for the recovery residence community, our parent organization, [Behave Health](https://behavehealth.com/), designs [future-proof tech for behavioral health](https://behavehealth.com/blog/2021/3/23/can-your-addiction-treatment-centers-ehr-handle-values-based-care) organizations of all kinds. Our industry-leading EMR draws on the latest findings in addiction treatment and recovery research to empower our clients to deliver truly cutting edge, evidence-based care to every patient, every time.

Our mission starts with excellent patient care, but it doesn’t stop there. That’s why we want to continue to build strong relationships with all the stakeholders who are invested in the future of behavioral health. 

If you fit into any of the following categories, we want to visit with you in Dearborn: 

## Researchers, Academics, and Research-Focused Providers

If you’re a self-described “data nerd,” you’re in good company. We’d love to chat about what your area of interest is and what challenges you’re facing when it comes to data collection and organization. 

We frequently incorporate academic findings about behavioral healthcare best practices into our software design, and we’d love to connect with you on the intersection of academic research, information technology and behavioral health. 

## Licensed Treatment Center Operators 

We design an EMR especially for treatment center operators called [Behave Health](https://behavehealth.com/). If you operate both treatment centers (inpatient, outpatient or residential) as well as recovery residences, then you’ll be pleased to know that Sober Living App and Behave Health are [fully interoperable](https://behavehealth.com/blog/2023/8/15/top-4-most-wanted-emr-features-for-addiction-treatment-in-2024), making it effortless to share data about patients across both platforms. 

## Federal, State and County Governments

The public sector plays a huge role in shaping access to behavioral healthcare for so many patients. It also safeguards vulnerable populations from exploitation while protecting public health at every turn. We’d love to connect with you about [regulations in your jurisdiction](../../../2021/8/3/understanding-national-regulations-on-sober-living-homes-in-the-united-states-part-1.html) as well as pending changes that may affect information technology in the behavioral healthcare landscape. 

## NARR Affiliate Leaders, Board and Team

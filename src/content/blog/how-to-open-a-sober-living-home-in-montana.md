Montana, affectionately known as the “Treasure State,” certainly is a gold rush for those in the sober living community. The state is sparsely populated and yet the demand for sober living, half-way housing and recovery residences is at an all time high. It’s estimated that [over 90,000 residents of Montana struggle with substance use disorder](<https://montanafreepress.org/2021/02/09/can-montana-get-a-grip-on-addiction/>). Methamphetamine use is particularly high in Montana, where courts, social services and correctional facilities are overburdened by individuals with methamphetamine use disorder. Montana’s suicide rate is [double the national average](<https://dojmt.gov/wp-content/uploads/Substance-Use-in-Montana-DOJ-FINAL-September-19th.pdf>) and owes, in large part, to an outsized addiction problem. While some sober living homes in Montana do encounter [NIMBYism and neighbor relations issues](<https://mtstandard.com/news/local/butte-spirit-center-turns-2-looks-toward-opening-women-s-recovery-home-in-2023/article_28ba8f88-c3d4-5ba1-a609-3d587e7f369b.html>), the state has shown no signs of wanting to regulate the sober living home community. 

This combination of high need and low levels of regulation make Montana a very attractive place to open a sober living home business.

## The Demand for Sober Living in Montana is Very, Very High

When sober living [makes the news](<https://www.ktvq.com/news/local-news/fire-destroys-billings-sober-living-facility>) in Montana, articles always mention how long the waitlists are for these facilities. In [one article](<https://www.montanarightnow.com/missoula/sober-living-residence-program-expands/article_41c7ae64-4f8c-11ed-89cd-0f4d69c5a9c4.html>), the operator mentions that the waitlist is months long. In [another](<https://mtstandard.com/news/local/butte-spirit-center-turns-2-looks-toward-opening-women-s-recovery-home-in-2023/article_28ba8f88-c3d4-5ba1-a609-3d587e7f369b.html>), a sober living home owner reports an average waitlist that’s approximately “six people long.” It’s fair to say that vacancy in Montana is very low for sober living. When doing a financial analysis, it's safe to use a low vacancy rate for Montana despite the low overall population. 

At this time, some 90% of people suffering from SUD in Montana receive no treatment of any kind. As state funding slowly increases for addiction treatment, it makes sense that the demand for sober living may increase as well, adding further demand to an already undersized system.

## Montana is Not Affiliated with the National Association of Recovery Residences - Yet

The [National Association of Recovery Residences](<https://narronline.org/>) (also known as NARR) is the national standard-bearer for the country’s greater sober living home community. They are responsible for establishing the rules and regulations that many states have adopted when crafting their own certification and licensing programs. Often these “best practices” are monitored by a private NARR affiliate in cooperation with the state government, who gives the final certification after a NARR affiliate review. 

In Montana, there is not yet any official body representing NARR. The NARR website lists Montana’s affiliate development as “in progress.” Several other states are in the same category. The length of time it takes to complete the process for incorporating as a NARR affiliate varies, so it’s difficult to say when Montana will have state-specific NARR representation. 

## Sober Living Homes in Montana Are Not Required to Seek Certification or Licensing

A study completed by The Mental Health & Addiction Certification Board of Oregon entitled, [National Overview of Recovery Housing Accreditation Legislation and Licensing](<https://mhacbo.org/media/NATIONAL.OVERVIEW.RECOVERY.HOUSING.January.2020.pdf>), describes Montana’s sober living home regulation with the following phrase: “No current private or state accreditation, and none under development.” 

In other words, Montana has no laws on the books that obligate or compel sober living homes to complete any type of certification or licensing requirements. Unlike some states, there are no rewards - like state funding or referrals - for licensed facilities. There are also no punishments or fees for failing to certify sober living homes in Montana. There are simply no requirements of any kind in this regard for sober living home operators in Montana, nor has the state legislature made any signals that indicate that there will be in the near future. 

That said, regulations are increasing nationally and it is possible that they will also come to Montana in the medium to long term. Operators will do well to keep an eye on the state government and watch for indications of impending regulation in the coming years. 

## You Can Research Existing Sober Living Facilities in Montana on the DPHHS Website

Montana’s official state website maintains a [database of existing chemical dependency facilities](<https://dphhs.mt.gov/amdd/substanceabuse/treatmentproviderinformation>) in the state, including sober living homes. Using this directory to better understand and analyze the competition is a smart move when developing your sober living home business plan. Look for holes in coverage, underserved areas and/or populations or other service gaps that you can leverage for your sober living enterprise.

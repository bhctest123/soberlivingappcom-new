Learn about how you can help your sober living home residents cope with pandemic stress with a trauma-informed approach.](/images/blog/4-ways-a-trauma-informed-approach-can-help-your-sober-living-residents-cope-with-pandemic-stress/Screenshot_2020-10-15_at_10.07.58_PM.png)

A history of trauma is very common among sober living residents. As we continue to delve deeper into the pandemic, we are all being exposed to the shared secondary (or primary, in some instances) trauma of living through these disturbing times. The effects of going through such a turbulent time will no doubt be the object of much study in the years to come. 

As [sober living home operators](/sober-living-app-blog/5-things-your-sober-living-home-manager-is-afraid-to-tell-you), what should we know about how trauma - past and present - are operating right now in our facilities? How can we support residents with a history of trauma during these traumatic times? What can we do to help residents cope with pandemic-related stress while building up their capacity for resilience? 

Today, we’ll look at four ways you can incorporate a [trauma-informed approach](https://ncsacw.samhsa.gov/userfiles/files/SAMHSA_Trauma.pdf) into your sober living home’s COVID-19 playbook. 

## Consider Screening New Sober Living Home Residents for Trauma

![Screen new sober living home residents for trauma so you can address trauma appropriately as symptoms become apparent.](/images/blog/4-ways-a-trauma-informed-approach-can-help-your-sober-living-residents-cope-with-pandemic-stress/Screenshot_2020-10-15_at_10.11.01_PM.png)

It’s difficult to address trauma when you don’t know it’s there. 

Implementing universal screening for trauma during your [new resident application](https://soberlivingapp.com/sober-living-app-blog/2020/4/28/introducing-our-new-resident-application-for-the-sober-living-home-app) process helps you get to know what your residents are up against in terms of their lifetime trauma exposure. When an incoming resident has a high level of trauma in their past, you’ll know in advance. This can help inform how you respond to everything from “behavior issues” to interpersonal conflicts with your trauma exposed residents. 

## Make The “New Normal” Predictable at Your Sober Living Home

![Trauma and chaos do not mix. Keep your sober living home’s routine regular and predictable to avoid triggers for residents with a history of trauma. This helps promote feelings of well being and control over situations in people with trauma historie…](/images/blog/4-ways-a-trauma-informed-approach-can-help-your-sober-living-residents-cope-with-pandemic-stress/Screenshot_2020-10-15_at_10.11.35_PM.png)

For residents with a history of trauma, unpredictable environments feel unsafe. COVID has [disturbed all of the daily routines](/sober-living-app-blog/3-coronavirus-changes-your-sober-living-home-needs-to-make-this-week) and patterns that signal to our brains that everything is normal. When big pattern shifts occur - like the ones we are all experiencing around COVID - trauma affected residents are more likely to respond negatively to the change. 

That’s why it’s so important to create as much pattern and predictability in our “new normal” as possible for your residents. Do everything you can to make sure that your sober living home’s COVID guidelines are predictable and consistent. Develop new routines around cleaning, visitation and socializing so that your residents always know what to expect, even during these uncertain times.  

## Institute the Buddy System or Other Peer Support Program at Your Sober Living Home

![If your sober living home doesn’t already use a buddy system, the pandemic is a great time to start. This helps residents with a history of trauma combat the negative effects of isolation and dissociation that often accompany trauma.](/images/blog/4-ways-a-trauma-informed-approach-can-help-your-sober-living-residents-cope-with-pandemic-stress/Screenshot_2020-10-15_at_10.12.44_PM.png)

Does your sober living home offer in-house peer support? 

Do you have a buddy system between residents? 

If the answer is no, now might be a good time to start. Consider linking up “old timer” residents with new residents. When trauma affected residents are experiencing symptoms of isolation and dissociation, a quick check in with a buddy can help turn their day around.   

## Get Curious About Problem Behaviors at Your Sober Living Home

![Behavioral issues among sober living home residents is often in part due to a history of trauma. Residents learn certain coping skills to deal with negative emotions that may or may not serve them in all contexts. For sober living home managers, und…](/images/blog/4-ways-a-trauma-informed-approach-can-help-your-sober-living-residents-cope-with-pandemic-stress/Screenshot_2020-10-15_at_10.09.51_PM.png)

Do you have a resident who is always breaking rules? Complaining? Starting fights? 

“Problem behaviors” are often warning signs of trauma. It’s tempting to ask such residents, “what’s wrong with you?,” but re-framing the question and asking, “what happened to you?” will most likely get better results. Often, the “problem behavior” you are picking up on is part of your resident’s trauma-related response. These responses might aggravate you, but your resident probably developed these behaviors as part of a survival strategy in response to their trauma. They are an expression of your resident’s will to survive in the face of adversity. 

## Keep the Focus on Resilience at Your Sober Living Home

The sober living home community is resilient. Together we will make it through this pandemic. 

Infusing a trauma-informed response into your sober living home’s COVID-19 plan means treating your residents’ stress responses as normal rather than pathological. Helping your residents lean into healthy coping behaviors and veer away from negative patterns that no longer serve them helps build life-long resilience that will see them through the pandemic and beyond.

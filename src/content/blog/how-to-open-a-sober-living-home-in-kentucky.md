Opening a sober living home in Kentucky is much easier than it is in most states in the country. The overall lack of regulation, coupled with some very pro-sober living home laws at the state level, make it an ideal location for operators who don’t enjoy working with a lot of red tape. Although there is a good amount of NIMBYism in Kentucky, fair housing laws work to the advantage of sober living home operators throughout the state. 

Today, we’ll look at what it takes to open a sober living home in Kentucky and highlight a few key pointers for those just getting started with recovery residences in the Bluegrass State.

## The Demand for Sober Living Homes in Kentucky is High

Kentucky is known for having a very large number of drug and alcohol treatment facilities per capita. While the number of treatment programs in Kentucky is large, the mounting overdose crisis in the state more than justifies the strong behavioral health presence. 

Overdose death rates in Kentucky have been on the rise since 2019 with over thirty counties reporting at least 60 overdose deaths per 100,000 residents in 2021. While this is a tragedy for Kentucky, it is a good indicator for sober living home operators that services are needed, and fast. 

There’s more good news about Kentucky for sober living home operators, too. The state received a [$478 million dollar settlement](<https://www.wtvq.com/kentuckians-call-for-regulations-for-sober-living-facilities/>) from prescription opioid manufacturers in recent years. Kentucky’s [Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission](<https://www.ag.ky.gov/Priorities/Tackling-the-Drug-Epidemic/Pages/Opioid-Abatement-Advisory-Commission-.aspx>) (KYOAAC) is still deciding how to allocate the money, but it’s likely that sober living homes may see a boost from this funding soon. 

## Apply for Certification with the Kentucky Recovery Housing Network if You’re Thinking of Opening a Sober Living Home in the State

The [Kentucky Recovery Housing Network (KRHN)](<https://www.chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dbhdid/Pages/krhn.aspx>) is the NARR state affiliate of Kentucky. Unlike many state affiliates which are operated as third-party entities, usually nonprofit organizations, KRHN is housed within the Kentucky government and makes its home in the Department of Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities. 

KRHN oversees the voluntary certification program for sober living homes that exists in Kentucky. Unfortunately, KRHN does not have an online portal for new applications, nor does it make its application packet available for download online. However, we know that KRHN follows the same standards issued by NARR, so we can expect that the application process is pretty straightforward. If you are interested in applying for KRHN certification, you’ll have to contact the Program Administrator by phone ( (502) 782-8478 or by email at jonathane.philpot@ky.gov.

KRHN also maintains a [list of certified residences](<https://dbhdid.ky.gov/dbh/documents/krhn/KRHN-Directory.pdf>) that’s worth a look during the market research phase of sober living home development. 

## Pay Attention to NIMBY City and Town Ordinances That Curtail Sober Living Homes in Kentucky

Kentucky’s [Revised Statute (KRS) 100.984](<https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=26885>) explicitly states that cities and towns may not restrict sober living homes from citing themselves in residentially zoned areas. This affirmation of fair housing laws at the state level offers strong protection for sober living home operators that many states don’t extend to the recovery community.

Although Kentucky’s state laws favor fewer regulations on sober living homes, many towns, cities and other municipalities in Kentucky have passed ordinances restricting - but not banning - sober living homes in residential areas. 

In the City of Bellevue, for example, sober living homes are restricted to housing now more than six residents in a single family home. [This ordinance](<https://bellevueky.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ORDINANCE-2022-03-02-SOBER-LIVING-HOUSES.docx-FINAL.pdf>) was passed in direct response to NIMBY complaints levied at sober living homes in R1 zoning areas. 

[Somerset](<https://www.somerset-kentucky.com/news/sober-living-residences-cause-concern-for-some/article_e0d27478-33a6-11ed-9490-97c5ba2f32bc.html>) also has seen movement around restricting sober living homes in residential areas. 

## Read the Recovery Housing in Kentucky Study and Apply its Findings to Your Business Plan

* If you’re considering opening a sober living home in Kentucky, it’s definitely worth you while to read the [Recovery Housing in Kentucky](<https://kiprc.uky.edu/sites/default/files/2021-06/LandscapeofRecoveryHousinginKentucky_Report_Dec2020.pdf>) study done in late 2020. This 57 page study details the contours of the existing Kentucky sober living home landscape and offers many statistics that might be useful to a new operator, including key challenges and recommendations for improving the sober living home offerings in the state. 

  * For example, the study explains that Kentucky has many sober living homes, but that it is lacking in homes located in the eastern and western parts of the state. Likewise, most homes are only open to single people and men in particular. Only 10% of homes welcome women with children and only 2% house families with children. Over 60% of Kentucky sober living homes are not handicap accessible, either. Digesting these facts about the existing landscape can help refine what a successful business strategy might look like for Kentucky sober living.

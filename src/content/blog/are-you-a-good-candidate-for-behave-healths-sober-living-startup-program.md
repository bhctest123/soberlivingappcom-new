## Have you always dreamed of opening your own sober living home? 

Welcome. You’re in the right place. 

Behave Health’s Sober Living Startup Program might be a good fit for you. 

## If there was ever an ideal time to open a sober living home, it’s now.

As money from [opioid settlements continues to flow](../../../2022/9/7/more-funding-opportunities-for-sober-living-homes-in-arizona.html) into communities across the United States, the demand - and funding - for sober living homes has never been higher. 

As the addiction crisis threatens our communities at unprecedented levels, sober living home operators are on the front lines, changing lives, healing families, and safeguarding communities from further damage. 

In its most recent criteria update, [ASAM went out of its way](../../../2023/10/13/asam-collaborates-with-narr-to-include-standards-for-sober-living-in-latest-asam-criteria-editionnbsp.html) to promote the importance of sober living homes to the addiction treatment process in general and the fight against our nation’s addiction crisis in particular. 

While regulations at the municipal, county, state and federal level [continue to shift](../../../2021/8/3/understanding-national-regulations-on-sober-living-homes-in-the-united-states-part-1.html) for sober living homes across the nation, one thing is clear: sober living homes are a vital component of the recovery community’s past, present and future. 

Making the choice to get involved in this movement is not only a financially savvy move, but it’s also a meaningful decision you and your family can be proud of for many years to come. 

## Have you always dreamed of opening a sober living home of your own but don’t know where to start?

If you’re interested in opening a sober living home, then it’s likely that you have some connection to this fight. 

Perhaps you…

  * Have lived experience as a sober living home resident.

  * Have been involved in managing or overseeing a sober living home in some way.

  * Have a family member or loved one who has benefitted from a sober living environment in the past.

  * Have some other personal experience or connection with the recovery community that has touched you deeply.

  * Are interested in bold, outside-the-box real estate investment strategies that satisfy your personal ethical standards for win-win-win solutions.

  * Just have a natural affinity for people who deserve a second chance and a desire to combine your business savvy with your instinct to help others in your community succeed.  

## What’s stopping you from opening a sober living home?

If you’re anything like the other entrepreneurs and founders who gravitate towards Behave Health’s Sober Living Startup Program, then you’ve probably run into more than a few roadblocks along the way as you consider or pursue your sober living startup. 

If you haven’t hit these roadblocks, you probably will soon.

**Frequent stumbling blocks to successful sober living start ups include:  **

  * Failing to develop a step-by-step plan for your project, start to finish

  * Facing too many choices (aka analysis paralysis)

  * Getting stuck on technicalities and boring details 

  * Lack of access to capital, funding, or financing 

  * Planning and zoning issues or concerns

  * Problems with the city or neighbors

  * Staffing issues, hiring problems 

  * Business plan development anxiety or procrastination

  * Failure to dedicate time to the process

  * Lack of focus

  * No accountability structure

  * Not knowing where to start 

  * Feeling overwhelmed

  * Not having enough confidence to make tough decisions

  * Market analysis issues 

  * Stubborn technical questions that you can’t Google

  * Lack of systems and structure to ensure success

  * Outstanding legal problems or questions 

  * Outstanding insurance problems or questions 

  * No referral partners, network, or plan 

  * No marketing plan 

  * No overall startup momentum

  * Working in fits and starts and then losing steam 

  * No access to other sober living home operators

  * No community to bounce ideas off of 

  * Not enough problem-solving partners

  * A general feeling that you need to “pick the brain” of other people who have done this before, but no way to really make that happen

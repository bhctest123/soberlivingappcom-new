## Montana organizes RRAM and begins enacting modest certification and registry requirements for sober living homes

Montana has been roiled in recent years by sober living home fraud scandals, ranging from Medicare fraud schemes to employment law violations. 

In response, the Montana sober living home community formed [RRAM](https://www.rramontana.org) in partnership with the Montana Department of Health and Human Services and the NADC. As the state’s NARR affiliate, RRAM has been issuing voluntary certifications to sober living homes that meet stringent criteria since 2023. 

Simultaneously, Montana’s government began seeking increased regulations for the state’s  [largely unregulated sober living home industry](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/01/03/the-unregulated-world-of-montanas-sober-living-recovery-homes/). While Montana still allows some sober living homes to remain uncertified, several different government agencies have [begun enacting modest reforms](https://nbcmontana.com/news/local/sober-living-home-operators-push-back-against-oversight-bill). 

With the passage of [Senate Bill 94](https://apps.montanafreepress.org/capitol-tracker-2023/bills/sb-94/?_gl=1*16r4d1b*_ga*YW1wLVNLMTRpcUdCRk9rZjJQanQtd1dkY2c.), Montana opened a state-wide registry for sober living homes, and began requiring sober living home operators to provide proof of certification if they wish to solicit referrals from government entities, such as those frequently made by judges, prisons, or probation and parole officers.

## Rhode Island sober living home NARR affiliate shifts from OSCRH to RICARES

![RICARES rhode island sober living home NARR affiliate was OSCRH](/images/blog/sober-living-home-regulations-for-narr-affiliate-operators-in-montana-rhode-island-delaware-and-vermont/Screen_Shot_2024-12-29_at_6.32.45_PM.png)

Sober living homes in Rhode Island have been going through several shifts in recent years in terms of NARR affiliation. 

It’s not news that sober living homes are required to provide proof of certification in Rhode Island if they wish to receive state funding or referrals, including any reimbursements from the Rhode Island department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities & Hospitals or [BHDDH](https://bhddh.ri.gov/substance-useaddiction/recovery-services/recovery-housing-certification). 

However, who provides that certification service has changed recently. In the past, an organization called The Ocean State Coalition of Recovery Houses, or[ ](https://www.recoveryhousingri.com/)OSCRH, was the NARR affiliate for the state of Rhode Island. Awkwardly, OSCRH was not chosen by the state to oversee the optional certification program. Instead, the state went through [RICARES](https://ricares.org/), an old and long-established recovery community advocacy agency, to oversee the certification program. Since then, OSCRH seems to have disappeared. RICARES has now replaced the organization as the official NARR affiliate for Rhode Island. 

Our older post, [Thinking of Opening a Sober Living Home in Rhode Island?, ](../../../2023/2/7/thinking-of-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-rhode-islandnbsp.html)was written before RICARES replaced OSCRH as the official NARR affiliate for the state.

## Delaware institutes voluntary certification program and gains NARR affiliate, FSARR this year

Delaware has seen a lot of regulatory activity for sober living homes and NARR affiliates in recent years. 

First, after a long fight, Delaware finally passed some initial sober living home regulations. At least 3 other attempts failed - including [House Bill 245](https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=47798), [House Bill 412](https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GenerateHtmlDocument?legislationId=109517&legislationTypeId=1&docTypeId=2&legislationName=HB421), and [House Bill 412](https://fastdemocracy.com/bill-search/de/151/bills/DEB00004717/) \- but House Bill 114 finally brought Delaware into the fold. As of early 2024, sober living homes are [required to provide proof of certification](https://www.wdel.com/news/delaware-begins-certification-process-for-recovery-residences/article_4a6d16a2-1872-11ef-84f0-9f9087e55412.html) if they want to accept state funding or referrals. HB 114 also created a centralized state registry for certified sober living homes. 

Second, Delaware recently gained its [own NARR affiliate](https://narronline.org/affiliate/first-state-alliance-of-recovery-residences/), FSARR, short for the [First State Alliance of Recovery Residences](https://fsarr.org/about/). FSARR began issuing certifications to sober living homes early 2024, as well. FSARR was chosen by the state to administer the voluntary certification program.

## Vermont’s NARR affiliate, VTARR, passes an act allowing sober living home operators to evict tenants that do not follow sobriety rules 

![Vermont VTARR NARR affiliate sober living home recovery residence tenant eviction program sobriety regulation certification news](/images/blog/sober-living-home-regulations-for-narr-affiliate-operators-in-montana-rhode-island-delaware-and-vermont/Screen_Shot_2024-12-29_at_6.33.02_PM.png)

In Vermont, sober living homes are not required to provide proof of certification in order to operate. In fact, there is still no official state-sponsored certification program - optional or otherwise - in the state. 

However, regulations are beginning to make headway in Vermont, as evidenced by the recent passage of [Act 163, aka S.186](https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2024/S.186). The act establishes a state mechanism for recording and surveying all sober living homes in Vermont, taking data collection on all entrance and exit numbers of residents entering and leaving sober living homes in Vermont, as well as naming a potential certification partner should the state enact a certification program. 

In addition, Act 163 makes it legal for sober living home operators to immediately evict sober living home residents who violate sobriety standards. Before the passage of Act 163, standard landlord law and due diligence made it possible for evicted residents who failed to pass sobriety tests to seek damages from sober living home operators for improper eviction proceedings. Now, sober living home operators are within their rights to immediately evict anyone who fails to maintain sobriety rules. 

Some [commenters](https://vtdigger.org/2024/05/07/tom-dalton-stripping-standard-protections-from-sober-house-tenants-is-unnecessary-and-dangerous/) felt that this act is an unfair violation of tenants rights, but the state’s NARR affiliate, the [Vermont Alliance for Recovery Residences](https://vtarr.org/), endorsed the bill.

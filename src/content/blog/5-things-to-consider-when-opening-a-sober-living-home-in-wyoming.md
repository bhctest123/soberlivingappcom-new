Wyoming is one of the least densely populated states in the nation, but that doesn’t translate into a low need for recovery housing. Although the overdose death rate in Wyoming is below the national average, rates of alcohol use disorder and suicide, in particular, are [well above national averages](https://www.kff.org/statedata/mental-health-and-substance-use-state-fact-sheets/wyoming/) in the Equality State. 

There is an unmet need for recovery housing in Wyoming. Read on to learn more about the top five things to consider when you’re thinking about opening a sober living home in Wyoming. 

## Wyoming is One of Only Two States in the Nation That Has Created Independent Rules for Sober Living Home Certification 

![wyoming sober living home legislation licensing certification accreditation chapter 7](/images/blog/5-things-to-consider-when-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-wyoming/Screen_Shot_2023-02-26_at_12.28.15_PM.png)

Sober living homes aren’t universally required to seek certification in Wyoming. However, if you want to accept public housing dollars or state funding of any kind at your recovery residence, you’ll need to complete the same certification process that addiction treatment centers and other levels of care go through in Wyoming. 

The process is a bit unusual in Wyoming. According to a [National Overview of Recovery Housing created by MHACBO](/mhacbo.org/media/NATIONAL. OVERVIEW. RECOVERY. HOUSING. January.2020.pdf), Wyoming is one of only two states in the nation that has created its own certification rules and regulations independent of NARR affiliated standards. The other state that does this is Arkansas. There is no third-party non-profit organization you’ll be dealing with during the certification process, instead, you’ll deal directly with the Department of Health. 

## Wyoming Calls Certified Sober Living Homes “Supportive Transitional Drug-Free Housing Services” 

![sober living home wyoming department of health rules and regulations certification state funding](/images/blog/5-things-to-consider-when-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-wyoming/Screen_Shot_2023-02-26_at_12.30.55_PM.png)

There are many synonyms in use for sober living homes. Every state has a different official term for sober living - transitional housing, sober living, recovery housing, recovery residences, etc. In Wyoming, the official term for sober living is “supportive transitional drug-free housing services.” 

It can be helpful to have this term in mind when you are searching for laws and regulations that apply to sober living in Wyoming. If you use the search words “sober living home” or “recovery residence” in official Wyoming state documents, you won’t find what you’re looking for. 

## You’ll Find All the Laws About Certified Sober Living Homes in the State of Wyoming Department of Health’s Rules and Regulations for Substance Abuse Standards 

Chapters one through seven of the [Wyoming Department of Health’s Rules and Regulations for Substance Abuse Standards](/wyoleg.gov/ARULES/2009/AR09-062Substance.pdf) lay out all of the rules for certified sober living in the state. 

Section three, in particular, covers “supportive transitional drug-free housing services,” so pay careful attention to that section. 

How does Wyoming define “sober living home?” Section 3(b) of the Rules and Regulations for Substance Abuse Standards defines sober living as: 

Supportive transitional drug-free housing services are non-clinically staffed, low intensity, peer-supported, life skills development living or housing environments. Supportive transitional housing services are independent facilities certified to provide supportive housing services with access to peer support, which include independent living skills development and stable functioning level in the community. 

Like addiction treatment centers, all supportive transitional drug-free housing services must be certified by the state in order to access state funding. 

## You Can Access a List of Certified Sober Living Homes in Wyoming on the State Website

Conveniently, the state of Wyoming provides a list of certified sober living homes on its website. You just need to access the [Wyoming Substance Use Certified Providers database](https://wyoimprov.com/MHSAPublicProviderSearch.aspx) and search for recovery residences under the “mental health community housing” tab. This will show all of the state-funded sober living facilities in the state. It does NOT, however, reveal all of the private pay only facilities in Wyoming. 

## To Get Your Sober Living Home Certified in Wyoming, Use the Application Portal on the State Website

Wyoming’s [certification program for recovery residences](https://health.wyo.gov/behavioralhealth/mhsa/certification/) who wish to receive state funds and take state housing dollars is administered by an [online application portal](https://wyhcbs.auth0.com/u/login?state=hKFo2SA3Y2U4Skk2bGs5dmJuME5NSHVwblE2NEtZV0hhV3VnWKFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIG5qZ2JndzVoTjAzUkFsX3NZLWxHamk3eFdDTkFNMnJHo2NpZNkgUHN1NldITXNuaTcwZVBQSEZSQnFRZ0N0SUlDalUzTEI). 

According to Wyoming law, the state has 60 days to approve or deny your application. The review “may” include an on-site inspection, depending on the availability of inspection staff. Should your facility not meet the state’s standards, you’ll be given 15 business days to share your plan to remedy the issues the state has found with your application. 

Unlike other states, which offer a lot of external, publicly available information on the certification process, Wyoming’s process is somewhat opaque.

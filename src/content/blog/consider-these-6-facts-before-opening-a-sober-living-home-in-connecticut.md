## Fact #1: Connecticut Does Not Require Sober Living Homes to Seek Certification or Licensing with the State

Although Connecticut’s Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services ([DMHAS](<https://portal.ct.gov/dmhas>)) does [maintain a listing of certified sober living homes](<https://www.ctaddictionservices.com/index.php?bedView=SH>) on its website, there is no law in Connecticut that states that sober living homes must be certified to operate. In fact, DMHAS does not, itself, even issue or oversee certification. That process is overseen by a private nonprofit organization called CTARR. ‘

## Fact #2: Sober Living Homes That Take Medicaid in Connecticut Are Overseen by Advanced Behavioral Health

Connecticut’s Medicaid system, also known as [Husky Health](<https://portal.ct.gov/HUSKY>), reimburses sober living homes at a rate of [$25 per day per bed](<https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Sober-houses-save-lives-but-critics-say-lack-of-17137427.php>). For homes that accept Medicaid dollars, a third party nonprofit called [Advanced Behavioral Health](<https://www.abhct.com/>). Advanced Behavioral Health calls itself a “behavioral health management company.” This organization works to ensure that all sober living homes that accept state dollars meet specific criteria outlined by the government. 

## Fact #3: The Connecticut Association of Recovery Residences (CTARR) is a Great Resource for Connecticut Sober Living Home Operators

[CTARR](<https://ctrecoveryresidences.org/>) is the [NARR](<https://narronline.org/>) state affiliate of Connecticut. This organization is responsible for certifying sober living homes according to the national standards established by NARR. CTARR certification is optional but it comes with many benefits, such as proof of legitimacy, professional advice and support, and lobbying representation at the state level. 

## Fact #4: CTARR is More Than Just Certification for Sober Living in Connecticut

In addition to overseeing certification in Connecticut, CTARR holds monthly meetings for members on Zoom on the last Tuesday of every month. They also host an annual golf tournament and a comedy night for members, both of which serve as fundraisers for the nonprofit organization. Connecticut is the only state in New England that does not contribute funding to its NARR affiliate organization, so these fundraisers are an important part of CTARR’s financial well being. 

## Fact #5: There Are Six Steps to CTARR Certification for Connecticut Sober Living Homes

There are 6 steps to completing the optional certification process for sober living homes in connecticut. They are: 

  * Step 1 - Determine what level of support you intend to provide at your sober living home. CTARR uses the levels of support outlined by NARR. NARR’s system involves four different levels of support, level one is the least intensive while level four is the most intensive. 

  * Step 2 - Submit your application online. 

  * Step 3 - CTARR reviews your application and you discuss any questions or concerns during a telephone interview.

  * Step 4 - Complete an onsite inspection of the physical plant. This will be the first of your yearly inspections with CTARR.

  * Step 5 - A certification determination is made and you receive your certification. It’s also during this step that your sober living home is listed on the CTARR website. 

  * Step 6 - Recertify. You’ll follow the first 5 steps again every year. 

## Fact #6: CTARR Certification Fees Are Reasonable for Connecticut Sober Living Homes 

CTARR’s certifications are good for one year. The cost is a flat $300 fee plus $1 for every bed in the home. There is an additional $100 fee for the onsite inspection, which must be completed every year along with the certification renewal. The onsite inspection fee is due for every home you operate, regardless of the number of homes you are certifying. The fee covers the time it takes to complete the inspection.

Indiana is a very sober living home friendly state. There are few regulations in place but there also exists ample government assistance for the process. Certification is optional, but beneficial if you want to seek state funding in any form. The application for certification is short but the list of attachments you’ll need to include with it is long. Opening a sober living home in Indiana is definitely an involved process, but it can be easily done with some determination and grit. 

## In Indiana, Sober Living Homes are Certified by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction

The Department of Mental Health and Addiction (or DMHA) [certifies “recovery residences”](<https://www.in.gov/fssa/dmha/recovery-residence-certification/>) that are [ranked as level 2, 3 or 4](<https://narronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NARR_levels_summary.pdf>). Level 1 residences are primarily peer run, often under the Oxford House model, and they are not offered certification by the state. 

## Sober Living Home Certification is Optional in Indiana

There is no law that says you must certify your sober living home with the state in Indiana. However, there are benefits to doing so. In 2017, Indiana state legislature passed a mandate that stated that all sober living homes receiving state or federal funding must go through the process of state certification. If your home will not accept any subsidy or grant money from the government, then you do not need to seek certification unless you elect to do so. 

## Definitely Read the “How to Open a Sober Living Home in Indiana” Guide Developed by the State Before You Begin

Indiana is among the few states that offer comprehensive information online about what it takes to open a sober living home within state lines. The crown jewel of that helpful ecosystem is [this amazing how-to guide](<https://www.in.gov/fssa/dmha/files/Recovery_Residence_How_To_Manual.pdf>) developed by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration Division of Mental Health and Addiction. The guide covers everything from budgeting, to funding, to organization, to insurance, NIMBY management, certification, staffing, and beyond. This is an invaluable resource for anyone looking to open a sober living home in Indiana and should be at the top of your pre-launch reading list. 

## The Application for Sober Living Home Certification in Indiana is Very Short and Simple

On the state government’s website, you’ll find the [Recovery Residence Certification Application - Recovery Works Housing Provider](<https://www.in.gov/fssa/dmha/files/RecoveryResidenceApplication.pdf>), an easy-fill, 2 page application PDF which you can complete online and email to [DMHAhousing@fssa.in.gov](<mailto:DMHAhousing@fssa.in.gov>). 

The application itself is simple. On it, you’ll need to include: 

  * Basic business information (name, location, contact information)

  * Attestations that you’ll do business ethically 

  * Attestations that your home meets basic health and safety requirements 

## Completing the Required Attachments for Sober Living Home Certification in Indiana is More Complicated 

While the application is simple, the [required attachments](<https://www.in.gov/fssa/dmha/files/RecoveryResidenceRequiredAttachmentsRevised.pdf>) you’ll need to include along with the certification application are numerous and less easily compiled. In order to get certified with the state of Indiana, your sober living home will need to submit: 

  * A floor plan 

  * Zoning documentation 

  * Proof of [State Fire Marshal Inspection](<https://www.in.gov/dhs/fire-and-building-safety/division-of-fire-and-building-safety-overview/>)

  * Proof of liability insurance 

  * A letter from the property owner, if renting, stating that it’s OK to run a sober living home in the building 

  * Mission statement 

  * Vision statement 

  * Code of ethics 

  * Staff plan with job descriptions, training plan, skill development plans

  * Detailed house rules 

  * Admission and intake plans and procedures 

  * Discharge criteria and plan 

  * Confidentiality statement based in [42 CFR Part 2](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-2>)

  * Social media policy for staff and residents

  * Grievance policy 

  * Resident’s rights and responsibilities document 

  * Billing policy

  * Health and contagious disease policy 

  * List of community resources for residents and alumni 

  * Good neighbor policy 

  * Weekly programming schedule

This is by far the most comprehensive and exhaustive list of required attachments we’ve seen from any state sober living certification application. Often we’ll see elements of many of these in application requirements but rarely will we see every single piece of possible documentation itemized like this. This application is doozy!

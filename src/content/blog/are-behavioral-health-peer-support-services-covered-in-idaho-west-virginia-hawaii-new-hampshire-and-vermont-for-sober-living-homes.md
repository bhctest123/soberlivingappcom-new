## Idaho Medicaid Reimbursement Rates for Peer Support Services is Low

Idaho Medicaid covers Peer Support Services for mental health conditions, but not Substance Use Disorder specifically. The state reimburses providers $13.63 for every 15 minutes of Peer Services provided to patients. In Idaho, [Peer Support Specialists](<https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/providers/behavioral-health-providers/peer-and-family-support-specialists>) are required to complete 46 training hours, 25 supervised work hours, and pass a formal exam. Peer support Specialists must have lived experience with SUD and/or recovery in order to work with clients.

## West Virginia Medicaid Covers Peer Support Services for SUD but Not Mental Health

West Virginia’s Medicaid coverage for Peer Support Services is similar to the situation in Idaho - except in West Virginia, it’s people with SUD who may access Peer Support Services, but those suffering from a mental health condition are not eligible. West Virginia reimburses providers $15.07 for each 15 minute unit of patient services delivered under the H0038 CPT code. This reimbursement rate is in-line with many other rates across the country. Like Idaho, West Virginia Medicaid requires Peer Support Specialists who have lived experience with addiction and recovery. Would-be Peer Support Specialists must complete 500 hours of work experience, 46 hours of training work hours, and 25 supervised work hours, in addition to passing an exam.

## Vermont’s Medicaid Coverage for Peer Support Services Likely Coming Soon

Vermont’s Medicaid coverage for Peer Support Specialist services is currently in flux. According to the [KFF database](<https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/medicaid-behavioral-health-services-peer-support-services/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D#note-20>), Vermont does not currently reimburse for Peer Support Services under its Medicaid program, making it one of the two states in the United States to fail to classify Peer Support Services as Medicaid-reimbursable. However, it seems very likely that this will change very shortly, thanks to [legislation that Vermont passed in June 2024](<https://vermontpsychiatricsurvivors.org/peer-certification-bill-passes/>). Now that a certification program is in place, Vermont legislators plan on getting a state plan amendment filled with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to make Peer Support Services provided by certified providers Medicaid-reimbursable.

## New Hampshire’s Medicaid Reimbursement Rates Make Peer Support Services a Good Option for Sober Living Home Operators

New Hampshire’s Medicaid program reimburses at a pretty high rate for both mental health Peer Support Services and SUD Peer Support Services. Each are reimbursable at $24.94 for each 15 minute block of services billed under CPT code H0038.. New Hampshire requires all [certified Peer Support Specialists](<https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/documents2/peer-support-specialist-certificate-program-requirements.pdf>) to have personal lived experience relevant to the population, as well as 500 hours of work experience, 46 hours of training, and 25 hours of directly supervised work hours. As with other states in this post, there is also an exam Peer Support Specialists in New Hampshire must pass in order to achieve certification.

## Hawaii Medicaid Covers Peer Support Services for Addiction and Recovery

Hawaii’s Medicaid program does cover Peer Support Services for both mental health and Substance Use Disorder patients. The reimbursement rate for both - $15.19 for every 15 minutes of services rendered - is about the national average. Like virtually every other state in the US, Hawaii Medicaid uses the H0038 CPT code to represent Peer Support Services. Hawaii requires certified Peer Support Specialists to pass an exam. But their training and work experience hours requirements “vary” according to a [recent report compiled by SAMHSA](<https://store.samhsa.gov/product/financing-peer-recovery-support-opportunities-enhance-substance-use-disorder-workforce/pep23-06-07-003>).

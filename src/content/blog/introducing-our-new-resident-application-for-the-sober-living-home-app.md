Big news at [The Sober Living App](/)!

We have been hard at work creating the most useful and easy-to-deploy new resident application ever made for the sober living home community. Now it’s ready to share. [Get your free trial now](https://signup.behavehealth.com/?product=sober_living_app) so you can see for yourself or read on to learn more!

Today we’ll go over some of the new features of the new resident application and all of the ways this new resident application will help make your sober living home business run more efficiently. 

## One Master Application = No Duplication of Efforts 

![You’ll never have to hassle with entering and re-entering annoying admissions information with the sober living app’s customized new resident application.](/images/blog/introducing-our-new-resident-application-for-the-sober-living-home-app/Screenshot_2020-04-24_at_1.16.16_PM.png)

Our new resident application is all cloud-based so your prospective residents won’t have to hassle with the logistics of paper applications. Simply send interested parties a link pointing towards your application. We take it from there. 

When a new application is submitted, you are instantly notified. All of the information your prospect entered into their application is automatically populated into the Sober Living App’s [powerful CRM](../../../../features.html#features-overview), which means you’ll never waste another minute on needless data entry while [processing new residents](/sober-living-app-blog/mastering-admissions-at-your-sober-living-home). When the application is accepted and the prospect is assigned a move-in date, converting their file to a “resident” file happens with the click of a button.  

## Customizable? Of Course!

![We have 22 different categories for you to choose from to create the ideal new resident application for your sober living home. Just choose what you want and you don’t - we’ll take care of the rest.](/images/blog/introducing-our-new-resident-application-for-the-sober-living-home-app/Screenshot_2020-04-24_at_1.18.32_PM.png)

Our new resident application template is designed to be flexible. We offer 22 different categories of information that you can gather on new residents. You get to decide what categories to include and what categories to skip. 

When deciding what to include, remember: the longer the application, the less likely an applicant will actually complete it. However, it is also important to gather the information you need to select strong candidates for your sober living home. 

Whether you decide to include all of the questions or pare down the application to the bare necessities, we empower you with everything you need to design a new resident application that suits the unique needs of your sober living home. Topics include: 

  * Personal Details

  * Demographics

  * Program Cost

  * Current Living Situation

  * Family

  * Substance Use History

  * Medical

  * Mental Health

  * Infectious Diseases

  * Medications

  * Treatment History

  * Recovery

  * Assistance & Help

  * Courts & Criminal Justice

  * Restrictions

  * Admissions

  * Client Statement

  * Employment

  * Personal Finance

  * Transportation

  * Sensitive Information

  * Additional Info

## Need to Screen New Residents for COVID-19? No Problem.

![Our new resident application can easily screen prospects for COVID-19. Add this option when you need it and easily drop it when the pandemic concludes.](/images/blog/introducing-our-new-resident-application-for-the-sober-living-home-app/Screenshot_2020-04-24_at_1.21.05_PM.png)

Our new resident application makes it easy to include standard [COVID-19 screening questions](../21/3-coronavirus-changes-your-sober-living-home-needs-to-make-this-week.html), such as:

  *  “Are you at risk for exposure to any infectious diseases, or have you been in contact with someone who has?”

  * ”Are you experiencing shortness of breath, coughing, fever, or other symptoms of Coronavirus and/or a flu?”

  * “Have you traveled outside of the country in the last 30 days?

As the science and regulations around COVID-19 evolve, we will continue to update the new resident application. We will ensure that you have up-to-date access to the information you may need to gather for infectious disease risk assessments of prospective residents.  

## Our Number One Priority is Always Security

![All of our applications - including the sober living app’s new resident application - are built with HIPAA in mind. The security of your data is paramount.](/images/blog/introducing-our-new-resident-application-for-the-sober-living-home-app/Screenshot_2020-04-24_at_1.21.53_PM.png)

As the premium cloud-based software provider for the addiction treatment and sober living home community, we at BehaveHealth and the Sober Living App are laser-focused on the security of your data. Everything we make—including the new resident application—[meets or exceeds the most stringent HIPAA security standards](../../../../security.html). 

When prospective residents begin their new application, they have four hours to complete it before the page expires. If a resident doesn’t complete the application in time, we will automatically email or text them a link to their saved application so they can resume it when they’re ready. You don’t need to personally follow up with prospects who haven’t completed their application—the follow-up is all done using smart technology to save you time and money. 

## Ready to Take Your New Resident Application to the Next Level?

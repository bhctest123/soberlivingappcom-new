Illinois is a popular state for sober living homes, which are also known as “recovery residences” in the state’s legal parlance. In 2019, [Illinois passed a law](https://abc7chicago.com/sober-living-halfway-house-recovery-home-oxford/5718891/) which created a voluntary registry and certification program for sober living homes in the state. This law makes certification through the state completely optional for operators. 

Certified and uncertified sober living homes are included in the [voluntary registry](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=101165), maintained on the state’s website. The list currently includes 104 “recovery residences” and over 50 Oxford Houses throughout the state. A [map of the registry](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=105159) shows that the majority of homes are located in Cook county and other counties in the Northeastern part of the state. 

## Will Illinois Start Imposing State Regulations on the Sober Living Home Community?

The 2019 law that created a voluntary registry as well as a [voluntary licensing program](/sober-living-app-blog/understanding-national-regulations-on-sober-living-homes-in-the-united-states-part-2) for sober living homes in Illinois is widely viewed as a “first step” towards imposing further regulations on the sober living community in the state. 

Illinois has a long history of NIMBY-led opposition campaigns against sober living home operators, with some of the questionable steps taken in communities throughout the state [facing opposition by the federal government](https://patch.com/illinois/hinsdale/feds-sue-hinsdale-over-fair-housing) for violation of fair housing laws.

If you’re interested in opening a sober living home in Illinois, consider joining the [Illinois Association of Extended Care](https://www.iaecrecoveryillinois.org), the local NARR affiliate in the state. This organization is a great resource for staying on top of local legislation and getting assistance around legal matters for sober living homes in Illinois.

## How Does the State of Illinois Define the Term “Recovery Home?”

The Illinois Department of Human Services draws a distinction between a “recovery residence” and a “recovery home.” For Illinois, a “recovery residence” is an umbrella term that includes both “recovery homes” and peer-run Oxford Houses. Illinois defines “recovery homes” as:

….alcohol and drug free housing components whose rules, peer-led groups, staff activities and/or other structured operations are directed toward maintenance of sobriety for persons who exhibit treatment resistance, relapse potential and/or lack of suitable recovery living environments or who recently have completed substance use disorder treatment services or who may be receiving such treatment services at another licensed facility. Administrative Code Title 77, Part 2060.509

In other words, “recovery homes” can be for-profit or non-profit organizations that provide housing to people in treatment or recovery from SUD. They may be “Florida Model” homes that are associated with an out-patient treatment center or they may be stand-alone facilities. Crucially, they are _not_ Oxford Homes. 

## Applying for Sober Living Home Certification in Illinois is Optional - and Easy

The application process for obtaining a sober living home license in Illinois shares a lot in common with the process for [applying for a license for an addiction treatment center](https://behavehealth.com/blog/2021/11/2/how-to-open-an-addiction-treatment-center-in-illinois) in the state. 

Illinois Department of Human Services hosts a [dashboard](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=29747) for providers which includes a handy link to the [multipurpose application](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/OneNetLibrary/27896/documents/By_Division/OASA/2020/Substance_Use_Disorder_Services_Application.pdf) sober living homes can use to apply for certification. Sober living home operators are most likely to choose “Level 3.1 - Residential Extended Care” on page 4 of the application to describe a community-based residence that provides 24-hour supervision and a safe place to practice recovery skills. 

Finally, Illinois also provides a [short FAQ](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=117273) regarding recovery homes, the state’s recovery residence registry and the state’s certification program.

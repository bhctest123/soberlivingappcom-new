We had a wonderful experience at this NARR conference [in 2023](<https://behavehealth.com/blog/2023/10/9/join-behave-health-at-the-the-2023-narr-conference-in-deerborn-michigan-oct-9th-11th>) and we’re so excited to return again for 2024 in Virginia! 

Don’t miss us at the [NARR Best Practices Summit](<https://events.narronline.org/2024/5340890?reg_type_id=575486>) in Richmond, Virginia from Monday, October 7th, 2024 through Wednesday, October 9th, 2024 at the Richmond Marriott Hotel in beautiful Richmond, Virginia.

We’ve been heads down at the office preparing a very special fireside chat for this year’s conference and we can’t wait to share it with you. 

We’ve titled our segment, “[Emerging Affiliates: Navigating Growth and Impact in Montana and New York](<https://events.narronline.org/2024/session/2507409/emerging-affiliates-navigating-growth-and-impact-in-montana-and-new-york?reg_type_id=575486>).” 

Ben Weiss, [Behave Health](<https://behavehealth.com/>)’s Founder and CEO, will be participating in this roundtable discussion alongside Peter Maney (Executive Director of the [Recovery Residence Alliance of Montana](<https://www.rramontana.org/>) and Project Director at the Native American Development Corporation), Van Smith, Jr. (President of [New York State Alliance of Recovery Residences, Inc](<https://www.nysarr.org/>) and Executive Director of [Recovery Houses of Rochester](<https://www.recoveryhousesofrochester.org/>)), and Ron Springel, MD (Executive Director of [Maine Association of Recovery Residences](<https://www.mainerecoveryresidences.com/>)). 

Catch us in the Capital Ballroom from 2:30pm until 3:30 on the first day of the conference, Monday, Oct 7th. 

## Who should attend our “Emerging Affiliates” roundtable discussion?

This is a great talk to attend if your state is still considering affiliation, is in the process of affiliating, or has recently affiliated. This is also a great space for policymakers and recovery housing advocates to get a better feel for the process of NARR affiliation from the inside. 

There are so many details and unforeseen challenges to cover in this fascinating talk. Don’t miss your opportunity to pose your best and most burning questions to these seasoned behavioral health executives. 

## What will “Emerging Affiliates” cover?

During the talk, you can expect to hear from Mr. Maney, Mr. Smith, and Dr. Springel about the challenges they’ve encountered and the solutions they’ve pioneered as representatives of three emerging and/or recently developed NARR affiliates during this dynamic time for new recovery home associations. 

In particular, we plan to cover: 

  * Common challenges facing all emerging and growing affiliates 

  * Proven strategies for rapid growth without sacrificing strict adherence to NARR standards 

  * Best practices for engaging with policymakers and key stakeholders in your state before, during, and after the affiliation process

  * Leveraging technology to navigate complex regulatory environments, like those found in New York State

  * Nuances of handling voluntary vs. mandatory certification processes

  * Tips and tricks for engaging in effective advocacy for your local recovery and sober living community 

  * How to identify and exploit unique opportunities for sober living home growth and excellence in your state

## Other talks we’re excited about this week in Virginia at the NARR Conference

There’s a lot of other great talks we’re looking forward to at this epic three-day event. Here’s some of the highlights we’re especially excited about: 

  * [Creating Inclusive Recovery Spaces: Supporting LGBTQ+ Individuals in Recovery](<https://events.narronline.org/2024/session/2507404/creating-inclusive-recovery-spaces-supporting-lgbtq+-individuals-in-recovery?reg_type_id=575486>) with Danielle Bonanno of Inclusive Recovery Athens and Brandy Anderson of Acceptance Recovery Center, Inc. This talk will highlight the lived experience of LGBTQ+ individuals in recovery and what we can do in the behavioral health community to provide this particularly vulnerable population with affirming care across the entire continuum of care, including recovery housing and other recovery spaces.

  * [Insurance & Risk Management for Recovery Residences](<https://events.narronline.org/2024/session/2507416/insurance-risk-management-for-recovery-residences?reg_type_id=575486>) with Lee Goldberg of BB Insurance Marketing, Inc. This talk addresses a perennially vexing issue for the sober living community: insurance, liability, and “what happens if…” Recovery housing is not without risk, and this talk addresses an indispensable element of every successful recovery housing program. 

  * [Strength in Lived Experience: Integrating Peer Support in Recovery Housing](<https://events.narronline.org/2024/session/2507438/strength-in-lived-experience-integrating-peer-support-in-recovery-housing?reg_type_id=575486>) with Stefanie Robinson of Hope Recovery Community. Peer Support has never been a hotter topic in the behavioral health community. The benefits of this model are endless and we are just getting started in incorporating this approach into our models of care. Peer Support Specialists, in particular, pose an incredible opportunity for those looking to expand the variety of services available to sober living home residents. 

  * [The Intersection of Substance Use Disorder, Human Trafficking, and Recovery Housing](<https://events.narronline.org/2024/session/2507440/the-intersection-of-substance-use-disorder-human-trafficking-and-recovery-housing?reg_type_id=575486>) with Autumn McCraw of WVARR. Human trafficking is a dark stain on the recovery community that needs to be addressed immediately. Bad actors, criminal activity, fraud, and dishonest business practices have no place in the future of recovery housing. This is an important talk for anyone interested in safeguarding the reputation of the sober living community, and, most importantly, the wellbeing of our residents. 

  * [Where Do We Go From Here? The Intersection of Policy, Practice, Research, and Recovery](<https://events.narronline.org/2024/session/2563808/where-do-we-go-from-here-the-intersection-of-policy-practice-research-and-recovery?reg_type_id=575486>) with David Best of Leed Trinity University, Dona Dmitrovic of SAMHSA, David Sheridan of NARR, Ashley Stewart of C4 Innovations, Emily Stuckey of ARCHway Institute, and Corrie Vilsaint of Harvard Medical School’s MGH Recovery Research Institute. It’s worth the wait - this capstone talk saves the best for last.

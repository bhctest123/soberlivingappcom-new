Utah has some of the strictest sober living home regulations in the United States. 

Both addiction treatment centers and sober living homes - also known as recovery residences - must obtain a license to operate in Utah. 

We’ve written before about what it takes to [open an addiction treatment center in Utah](<https://behavehealth.com/blog/2022/2/25/considering-licensing-an-addiction-treatment-center-in-utah-youre-in-for-a-treat>), but today we’ll cover what goes into opening a sober living home in the Beehive State. 

## Understanding the Technical Definition of a Recovery Residence (AKA Sober Living Home) in Utah

[Utah Code 62A-2-101(36)](<https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title62A/Chapter2/62A-2-S101.html>) delineates Utah’s definition of a “recovery residence,” which is Utah’s official term for a sober living home or half-way home. The code contains a fairly basic outline with some quirks. In essence, the code states that recovery residences must meet at least two of the following five requirements to be considered a “recovery residence:” 1) offers a supervised environment for those in recovery from SUD, 2) at least half of residents are in recovery 3) arranges treatment for those in recovery from SUD on or off site 4) is “held out” as a sober living home where people can live together in recovery and/or 5) takes public funding and/or operates as a for-profit or non-profit venture.

Utah [Administrative Code R501-18, Recovery Residence Services](<http://utrules.elaws.us/uac/r501-18>) establishes the “basic health and safety standards” and “minimum administration requirements” for sober living homes in Utah. 

## Sober Living Homes in Utah Must be Licensed Before Opening

All sober living homes, with a few exceptions, must seek licensure with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services Licensing and Background Checks division. Utah categorizes these licenses as “[human services type licenses](<https://dlbc.utah.gov/providers/license-types>)” along with such entities as foster care programs, adult day care programs and therapeutic schools. 

You can find the [application for Utah sober living home licensing](<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VctUj4qX1QDYbYkLJ02lImi4hch1NRSj>) online. It’s a 17 page document that has many components. Set aside a significant amount of time to complete the application but know that a large portion of the application is simply a checklist to ensure that your policies and procedures manuals conform to Utah’s strict requirements. When completing the application, you’ll be asked many standard specifics about your program, as well as some unusual questions, like: 

  * What potential conflicts of interest exist with your sober living home? 

  * Have you already been denied DHS licensure? 

  * Have you had your license revoked in the past 5 years? 

  * Who will act as your “screening agents” for carrying out background screens according to Utah rules? 

## There are Four Steps to Applying for a Sober Living Home License in Utah

Getting licensed is a four-step process in Utah. 

Step #1: Submit your application 

Step #2: Submit additional paperwork to support your application

Step #3: Complete the necessary background checks 

Step #4: Complete your safety inspection

## Licensing Fees for Sober Living Homes in Utah are Unusually High

It costs $1295 to apply to become licensed in Utah. There is no per-bed fee, so this is a flat fee for all sober living homes regardless of size. Only Outdoor Youth Programs have higher fees in Utah. Nearly $1300 for an initial application fee is pretty steep in the United States for state sober living home licensing fees. 

## The List of Requirements for Licensing for Sober Living Homes in Utah is Very Long

Utah’s [Recovery Residence Checklist is available online](<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y8WTcuK6Fvct00Jsxye1X6ma4x8Fo4kO/view?usp=sharing>) for anyone considering opening a sober living home to review during the planning phase. The checklist is 6 pages long and is very detailed. It is beyond the scope of this article to go over every requirement covered in this checklist but a few highlights are: 

  * Sober living homes must “ensure that clients receive” supportive services such as vocational services, peer support, skills training and community resources 

  * Sober living homes must maintain a list of all current residents 

  * The recovery residence director must have a social services license or significant experience and education in recovery services 

  * The director must maintain pretty elaborate hiring and training standards for anyone hired at the home 

  * Daily on-site visits are required daily from the manager or director 

  * The director or manager must make face-to-face or telephone meetings with each resident on a daily basis 

  * The home must observe specific square footage requirements: a minimum of 60 square feet per resident 

  * Anyone preparing shared meals must have a food handlers’ card 

  * Menus must be made available upon request 

  * There must be enough seating at the dinner table to accommodate all residents 

In addition to these requirements, Utah levies more standard requirements, such as: 

  * Basic fire code requirements 

  * Medicine lock-up rules 

  * Policy and procedure manuals

  * Client’s rights information 

  * Reporting requirements 

  * Discharge requirements 

  * Intake application and assessment criteria

  * No treatment allowed in recovery residences without an additional addiction treatment license

## Be Aware That There is a New Funding Option for Utah Sober Living Homes

It can be difficult to find funding to help with opening a sober living home in many states. This is not necessarily the case in Utah. If you’re looking to open a sober living home, take note of the HEAR Program. In 2022, Utah’s [Department of Human Services](<https://sumh.utah.gov/>) launched a $4 million dollar [grant initiative](<https://www.standard.net/news/health-news/2022/mar/08/utah-addiction-recovery-programs-receive-state-grant-funding/>) for addiction treatment programs called the [Health, Exercise and Addiction Recovery (HEAR) Program](<https://dsamh-training.utah.gov/_documents/mediareleases/HEAR_Press_Release.pdf>).

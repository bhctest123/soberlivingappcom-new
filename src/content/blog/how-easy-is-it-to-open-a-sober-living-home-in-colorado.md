The short answer? Relatively easy. 

The long answer? Colorado recently enacted a law requiring nearly all sober living homes in the state to seek certification with the Colorado NARR affiliate, the Colorado Association for Recovery Residences. While the organization does require a fair amount of documentation, it also offers a lot of assistance to would-be affiliates and is available to help orient new operators to the state requirements that need to be met in order to get certified.

## Colorado Recently Passed a Law That Requires All New Sober Living Homes to Get Certified

Nearly all sober living homes in Colorado are [now required to seek certification](<https://www.pinkowskilaw.com/assisted-living-blog/2020/5/1/sober-living-homes-in-colorado-now-require-certification>) in order to operate in the state of Colorado. 

However, there are a few exceptions. The following sober living homes are exempt from this new requirement: 

  * Oxford houses that are officially chartered by Oxford House International 

  * Homes that have already been certified by the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration

  * Homes that have been in operation in the state for more than 30 years as of May 23, 2019

  * Homes that are considered to be “community-based reentry services”

You can read the letter of the law [here](<https://advance.lexis.com/documentpage/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=dcb3278a-9eb6-4f18-bba3-cf19681a55cd&config=014FJAAyNGJkY2Y4Zi1mNjgyLTRkN2YtYmE4OS03NTYzNzYzOTg0OGEKAFBvZENhdGFsb2d592qv2Kywlf8caKqYROP5&pddocfullpath=%2fshared%2fdocument%2fstatutes-legislation%2furn%3acontentItem%3a65KK-NB13-CGX8-048W-00008-00&pdcontentcomponentid=234176&pdteaserkey=sr0&pditab=allpods&ecomp=vs65kkk&earg=sr0&prid=291b06bd-91cd-490e-a19b-c0a8f38fd6ff>). Unless your organization falls under one of these categories, you’ll need to follow the certification process before marketing your sober living home in Colorado.

## You Can Get Your Sober Living Home Certified by the Colorado Association of Recovery Residences

The [Colorado Association for Recovery Residences ](<https://carrcolorado.org/>)is the only place to apply for certification in Colorado. 

You can access their [online application](<https://form.jotform.com/CARRListing/certification-only-application>) or [download application forms](<https://carrcolorado.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CARR-COMPLETE-FORM-PACK_4.22.2022.zip>) on their website. Once you’ve completed the application, you simply email all the required documents to [info@carrcolorado.org](<mailto:info@carrcolorado.org>). 

Upon receipt of your completed application, CARR will issue you an invoice for the fees. After you’ve submitted your fees and emailed all of the relevant documentation to CARR, you will receive an inspection date for a physical inspection of your facility. 

If you pass your inspection, CARR will add you to its list of certified recovery residences. If there’s an issue with your physical inspection, CARR will give you 30 days to remedy the situation and achieve compliance. At any point in the process, you can contact CARR by phone at 720-782-0989. 

## The CARR Fees for Certifying Your Sober Living Home in Colorado Are Reasonable…

CARR charges affiliates $500 per organization and another $200 for every home within that umbrella organization. These fees are used to cover organizational expenses including employee salaries and inspection costs.

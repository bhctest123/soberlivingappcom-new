Arizona is a very popular state for opening a sober living home, and for good reason. There is a high demand for addiction treatment in the state, and many would-be patients travel to Arizona for the healing atmosphere of the desert. 

We’ve written elsewhere about [how to open a sober living home in Arizona](<https://soberlivingapp.com/sober-living-app-blog/2022/8/9/5-hacks-for-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-arizona-quickly>) and we’ve also pointed you in the direction of Arizona states’ [Sober Living Fact Sheet](<https://www.azdhs.gov/documents/licensing/special/sober-living-homes/sober-living-fact-sheet.pdf>), which lays out all of the ins and outs of sober living home licensing in the state. 

Today, we’ll discuss a new funding opportunity for certain sober living homes in Arizona. 

## The “State of Arizona Recovery Housing Program Action Plan of 2021” is Good News for Sober Living Home Operators

The Arizona Department of Housing announced the current version of its Recovery Housing Program (RHP) in 2021. The agency runs the RHP program to specifically promote temporary housing for low-income individuals in recovery from SUD in Arizona. Anyone who gets Medicaid in Arizona (called the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System) is typically eligible for housing through RHP. 

## Take Note: Arizona’s Recovery Housing Program Won’t Fund All Types of Sober Living Homes

RHP will dole out significant funds to certain sober living facilities - namely private or public nonprofits only. If you’re running your sober living home for profit, you’re out of luck with RHP. If, however, you are considering a nonprofit venture, then read on for how the RHP works, how much funding you can expect and what the pros and cons of the program are. 

## Where Does Sober Living Home Funding from the Recovery Housing Program Come From?

The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development granted the [Arizona Department of Housing](<https://housing.az.gov/>) (ADOH) $820,208 in funding for fiscal year 2021 to disseminate to qualified sober living home operators through the Recovery Housing Program. Arizona was chosen, among other states, because of the high addiction rates and overdose death counts documented in the area. The funding is part of a pilot program to see if this type of assistance improves addiction recovery outcomes in the state. 

## What Arizona Sober Living Homes are Eligible to Receive This Funding?

Your sober living home is eligible for a chance at securing a sober living home grant from the Recovery Housing Program if your program is: 

  * A public or private nonprofit organization

  * Outside Maricopa County 

  * Outside Pima County

  * Follows [24 CFR 570.489](<https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/24/570.489>)

  * Adheres to federal labor standards (see the [Davis-Bacon Act](<https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/laws-and-regulations/laws/dbra>))

  * Avoids interrupting the supply of low income housing (i.e. doesn’t demolish or repurpose existing functional low income housing to build an unaffordable or less dense sober living home, see [24 CFR 42.375](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-24/subtitle-A/part-42/subpart-C/section-42.375>))

  * Minds [CFR 200](<https://azdot.gov/sites/default/files/media/2021/06/LPA-M3-Grants-Mgmt.pdf>), keeps records and sound accounting

## What are Recovery Housing Program Grantmakers Looking for in Eligible Sober Living Homes?

In addition to the above factors which constitute eligibility for consideration there are a few “nice to have” attributes that will improve the odds of your application resulting in a grant: 

  * Your facility serves 8 or more individuals in recovery 

  * You graduate at least 8 or more individuals in recovery to permanent housing every year 

  * Your home provides case management

  * Your home provides lifeskills training such as vocation training and help with social skills 

  * Your home provides employment as a part of housing

## Does Your Sober Living Home Have to be Licensed in Arizona to Receive Recovery Housing Program Funds? 

Yes. All sober living homes must seek and [receive a license from the state](<https://www.azdhs.gov/documents/licensing/special/sober-living-homes/sober-living-complete-application.pdf>) in order to operate in Arizona. Some [municipalities in Arizona](<https://www.phoenix.gov/cityclerksite/MediaAssets/Structured%20Sober%20Living%20Home%20License%20Application%20Packet.pdf>) require a separate license or certification to operate within city limits, additionally. Because of these state laws, all sober living homes must be licensed in order to seek Recovery Housing Funds.

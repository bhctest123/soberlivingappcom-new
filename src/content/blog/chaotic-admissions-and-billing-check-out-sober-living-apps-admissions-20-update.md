#  [Chaotic Admissions and Billing? Check Out Sober Living Apps' Admissions 2.0 Update]

One of the best parts of working on the team at the [Sober Living App](/) is working with sober living home operators around the country. Leading by example, the recovery housing community continually inspires us to work harder and stretch further than we thought possible. 

At the Sober Living App, we don’t just serve the recovery community, we are the recovery community. 

That being the case, it makes sense that we take a lot of our business ideas and inspiration directly from the wisdom of the recovery community. 

Here’s one of the big ones: **We’re always hustling to improve the service we offer to others.**

As COVID-19 has swept through the country, we’ve all changed the way we live. The sober living world has felt these changes acutely. 

At the Sober Living App, we listen when our users tell us that things need to change, and fast. So, we rolled up our sleeves and got to work, making the best all-in-one software solution for sober living home operators even better and even more useful in a changing world. 

The result? A smoother and more powerful app experience than you ever imagined, especially designed to take on all of [the new challenges](../../3/31/5-ways-coronavirus-is-changing-the-sober-living-industrynbsp.html) sober living home operators are facing today.

Read on to learn about the brand new features you’ll find in the new [Sober Living App Behave Admissions 2.0 Summer 2020 Update](https://info.behavehealth.com/en/behave-health-summer-2020-update).

## Problem: Your clunky, time consuming admissions process involves a ton of multicolored paperwork, a lot of signature bottlenecks and awkward payment collection. 

![Put your admissions process in the cloud and forget about the paperwork chaos. Every sober living home needs a simple, clean way to process admissions that saves time and sanity.](/images/blog/chaotic-admissions-and-billing-check-out-sober-living-apps-admissions-20-update/_1.png).png)

## Solution: Our Summer 2020 Update removes all remaining admissions drama and replaces it with a zen-like digital process that’s 100% clean, simple and smart. 

Here’s how. 

A singular workflow eliminates user error and guides even the most newbie employee through the entire process, start to finish. 

The application form is customized. It’s online in the cloud. Potential residents can fill it out on their phone wherever they are. Once completed, all of the information they’ve entered into the application automatically populates the rest of your system.

Finally, we’ve added one-click signature gathering to our admissions process so you can now collect signatures via text or email from all parties. No more bottlenecks. 

## Problem: Your cash flow has slowed to a trickle. You’re not paid, or if you are paid, it’s not on time. Your “billing department” is an afterthought. Worst case? You’re tracking “money stuff” on a spreadsheet.

![Built in billing? Yes. Sober Living App’s automatic billing assistant automates everything you hate about your billing process.](/images/blog/chaotic-admissions-and-billing-check-out-sober-living-apps-admissions-20-update/image-asset.png)

## Solution: Step away from the spreadsheet and meet your new bespoke billing assistant, designed especially for sober living home operators. 

Create a services menu using the services book feature and change the pricing wherever you want. 

Take 10 different types of payment, including Venmo and CashApp, automatically through our resident portal. 

Let mom and dad cover payments easily with our simple multiple payer feature. 

Wasting time chasing late payments? Stop. Our recurring automatic billing assistant creates new bills as they become due and sends automatic reminders to residents until they pay up. 

## Problem: COVID-19 has generated several new categories of information that you need to collect from residents. Temperatures and test results are buried in electronic notes or jotted down on stickies.  

![COVID-19 is sticking around for a while. We’re setting you up with the tools your sober living home needs to deal with it professionally.](/images/blog/chaotic-admissions-and-billing-check-out-sober-living-apps-admissions-20-update/Screenshot_2020-09-16_at_11.31.15_AM.png)

## Solution: Build COVID into your system. 

As we’re learning, the [coronavirus is not temporary](https://soberlivingapp.com/sober-living-app-blog/2020/4/21/3-coronavirus-changes-your-sober-living-home-needs-to-make-this-week). This “new normal” is going to be happening for a while. We’ve accepted what we can’t change, and you can, too. In our summer update, you’ll find:

  * Vital signs tracking (including temperature)

  * COVID-19 test results tracking 

  * Specific coronavirus risk-factor questions built into the new resident application

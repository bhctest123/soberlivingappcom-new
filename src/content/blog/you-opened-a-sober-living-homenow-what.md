So, you finally went all in and opened a sober living home—congratulations!

You probably already know what a [great investment](https://www.tradingacademy.com/lessons/article/investing-in-real-estate-as-a-sober-living-facility/) sober living is right now and what a [high demand](https://www.marketplace.org/2013/04/05/life/renting-homes-recovering-addicts-profit) there is for this type of service. You’re feeling confident—and rightly so—about your sober living home as a smart investment and a sound contribution to your community. 

Of course, opening the facility wasn’t easy. You researched the zoning, made a business plan, hired your house manager, leased or purchased the property, established resident criteria, and prepared a policy handbook. You’ve negotiated insurance, neighbors, marketing, furnishings, and rental agreements. 

Now that’s all done, it’s going great—and you’re probably already seeing some cash flow—but you’re starting to notice that this income is _far from passive_. 

In fact, running a sober living home is turning out to be **a lot of work**! 

The good news is there are [solutions out there](http://soberlivingapp.com) to make opening and managing a sober living home easier. 

Opening a sober living home is a big commitment, but your investment doesn’t need to consume your life! 

## Managing Tenants, Vacancies, and Incidents in a Sober Living Home 

![Managing a sober living home can easily turn in to a round-the-clock job. Smart property management software can make the difference between a successful investment and an all-consuming job.](/images/blog/you-opened-a-sober-living-homenow-what/jugglingmanonbeach.png)

Keeping track of your tenants, your properties, your house managers, and your vehicles is more than a full-time job.

Between managing repairs and routine maintenance of your assets, scheduling house manager shifts, staying on top of room assignments, minimizing vacancies, and documenting incidents in your sober living home, you’ve got a lot going on. 

At BehaveHealth, we developed our [Sober Living App](/) to keep the management workflow of your investment predictable and organized. Imagine how much time you would save if all the moving parts of your sober living home were automatically tracked and documented in a secure, cloud-based system accessible from any device! 

At BehaveHealth, we make this dream a reality for our clients. 

All the information [you and your staff need](../../../../housing.html) lives in one, centralized, easy-to-access location. That means all drug test results, house manager shifts, maintenance information, property management, clinical management, file storage, bed management, incident reports, and ongoing incident notes are available to you and your staff at the click of a button. 

## Managing Sober Living Clinical Operations 

![Keeping track of appointments and meetings at your sober living home can be challenging.](/images/blog/you-opened-a-sober-living-homenow-what/recoverymeeting.png)

Are you offering clinical services at your sober living home? 

Keeping track of individual counseling appointments, group therapy appointments, and [insurance billing](https://behavehealth.com/blog/2019/4/2/3-secrets-of-efficient-insurance-billing-for-drug-rehabs) is probably another big item on you (or your staff’s) to-do list. 

With BehaveHealth’s Sober Living App, your patients view and pay their bill online. Treatment plans, [case management notes](../../../../operations.html), and community connections (like AA meetings or other coordinated care providers) live in the cloud for quick access by all of your staff. 

No more juggling appointment books, no-shows, and cancellations. Your patients can view their appointments on the patient portal and their attendance is automatically logged every time they make a meeting. 

## Keeping the Beds Full and Managing Admissions in Your Sober Living Home 

![Keeping beds full at your sober living home is an important aspect of success. Fast tracking admissions with smart online applications and forms, as well as sophisticated CRM software to track leads, can help fill vacancies and keep you in the black.](/images/blog/you-opened-a-sober-living-homenow-what/manopeningdoor.png)

Getting and keeping your beds full and maintaining a low vacancy rate is critical to your sober living home’s success. 

That’s why at BehaveHealth, we’ve made [custom tools](../../../../admission.html) to streamline the sober living admissions process and track resident leads. 

To start, BehaveHealth’s Sober Living App’s built-in “New Resident Application Form” takes the guesswork out of screening new residents. Prospective residents access the application online and input all their information into your [CRM](https://behavehealth.com/crm#crm-overview), which then travels with them throughout the patient lifecycle, cutting down on annoying, redundant data entry. 

Next, our built-in online payment collections service makes the collection of upfront fees easy and painless. 

Finally, our robust CRM tracks where your new resident leads are coming from and allows you to focus on the community partnerships that are working best for you. No more guessing about where referrals are coming from. 

## Setting Sober Living Alumni Up for Success and Tracking Outcomes

![Tracking alumni and helping them achieve success in sobriety helps you collect outstanding outcomes data for your sober living home.](/images/blog/you-opened-a-sober-living-homenow-what/sobergraduates.png)

You’re probably beginning to notice that the work of sober living home management doesn’t stop once residency does. 

Sober living alumni can be powerful referral partners and community supporters of your sober living home’s mission. 

At BehaveHealth, we know how valuable sober living alumni are to the health of a vibrant sober living community. 

That’s why we treat our client’s alumni to an [exclusive alumni portal](../../../../alumni.html) where graduates can easily stay in touch with your facility, access their discharge plan, and explore recovery resources. The alumni portal is generated automatically upon discharge, making outcome tracking, relapse intervention, and readmission, if necessary, a seamless process.

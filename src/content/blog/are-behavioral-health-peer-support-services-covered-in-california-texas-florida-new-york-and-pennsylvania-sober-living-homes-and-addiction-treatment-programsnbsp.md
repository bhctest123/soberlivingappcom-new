## What Kinds of Sober Living Homes Generally Offer Peer Support Services? Are Peer Support Services Right for your Recovery Residence? 

![SAMHSA best practices for recovery housing peer support services guidelines](/images/blog/are-behavioral-health-peer-support-services-covered-in-california-texas-florida-new-york-and-pennsylvania-sober-living-homes-and-addiction-treatment-programsnbsp/Screen_Shot_2024-05-29_at_9.02.44_PM.png)

According to SAMHSA’s [Best Practices for Recovery Housing](https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/pep23-10-00-002.pdf), it’s very common for sober living homes and recovery residences to add peer support services to their programming. Although not all sober living environments do this, it can be a lucrative add-on for operators, as well as a meaningful and supportive service for residences. In fact, peer support services are an evidence-based service for people in early recovery and are increasingly considered to be an indispensable part of the continuum of care. 

The National Association of Recovery Residences, or NARR, recognizes four distinct levels of sober living environments. It’s typical for levels three and four to incorporate peer support services. 

In Level 3 homes, it’s common to find a paid house manager, an administrative support assistant, as well as a certified peer recovery support service provider who meets with residents regularly. 

In Level 4 homes, it’s generally expected that peer recovery support specialists will be offered as an on-site service.

## What is the CPT Billing Code for Peer Support Services in California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania Sober Living Homes?

![billing CPT codes peer support services california texas florida new york pennsylvania sober living home H0038 modifiers telehealth group](/images/blog/are-behavioral-health-peer-support-services-covered-in-california-texas-florida-new-york-and-pennsylvania-sober-living-homes-and-addiction-treatment-programsnbsp/Screen_Shot_2024-05-29_at_9.02.51_PM.png)

Peer support services are typically billed using the CPT code, H0038. When those services are provided within the context of an addiction treatment program, the modifier “HF” can be tacked on to the end. Some sober living homes are technically addiction treatment programs, but many are not. If your sober living home does not provide addiction treatment, then you’ll want to omit the “HF” modifier. 

In some cases, other modifiers may be relevant, such as the “HQ” modifier, which describes services provided in a group setting. An educational group session conducted by a peer recovery specialist is a good example of an occasion where the “HQ” modifier may be appropriate. 

If the peer support professional provides services via telehealth, an increasingly popular and practical option, then the “GT” modifier may be used.

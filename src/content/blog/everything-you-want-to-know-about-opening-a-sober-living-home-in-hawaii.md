## Must all sober living homes in Hawaii be licensed? 

No. Hawaii Department of Health, Alcohol & Drug Abuse Division does not issue licenses or certifications for sober living homes. However, the regulatory body does manage a [voluntary registry](https://portal.ehawaii.gov/home/online-services/cshome/) for what they term “clean and sober homes.” 

## What is the Clean and Sober Homes Registry in Hawaii?

![](/images/blog/everything-you-want-to-know-about-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-hawaii/Screen_Shot_2023-01-22_at_6.35.30_PM.png)

In 2014, Hawaii’s House of Representatives passed [Act 193](../../../../../www.capitol.hawaii.gov/sessions/Session2015/Testimony/HB1291_TESTIMONY_HLT_02-18-15_.PDF), which established the “Clean and Sober Home Registry” and altered county zoning laws to accommodate sober living homes. The registry was [finally launched in 2019](https://nichawaii.egov.com/hawaiis-clean-and-sober-home-registry-provides-support-for-recovery-efforts/). The registry itself is described in [Chapter 178 of Hawaii Administrative Rules](https://casetext.com/regulation/hawaii-administrative-rules/title-11-department-of-health/subtitle-1-general-departmental-provisions/chapter-178-clean-and-sober-homes-registry). It is essentially a special list of homes that have passed state inspection. The homes must meet certain criteria in order to be entered in the the list. 

Registered and in good standing with the “clean and sober homes registry” can advertise that they are “clean and sober homes”

## What is the process for being entered into the Clean and Sober Home Registry in Hawaii? 

![Hawaii clean and sober home registry how to be entered](/images/blog/everything-you-want-to-know-about-opening-a-sober-living-home-in-hawaii/Screen_Shot_2023-01-22_at_6.37.22_PM.png)

The process is fairly straightforward. It involves an [application](https://cshome.ehawaii.gov/), along with a review of that application and a request for any additional documentation, if necessary. When the documentation phase is complete, the Department of Health, Alcohol & Drug Abuse Division schedules a walk-through inspection of the sober living home and renders a decision: “in good standing” or “not in good standing.” Homes found to be in good standing are added to the registry. 

## What documentation is required for adding my sober living home to the registry in Hawaii?

Requirements for registration are typical of other state’s sober living regulations. They include: 

  * A mission statement, code of ethics, as well as various policy and procedure entries into a sober living home management manual 

  * Screening criteria for onboarding new residents 

  * Demonstrated fiscal management system 

  * Proof of insurance 

  * Resident’s rights and responsibilities documentation 

  * Grievance procedure 

  * Basic fire and building safety requirements 

  * Good neighbor agreements regarding noise, smoking, etc 

The [compliance checklist](../../../../../health.hawaii.gov/substance-abuse/files/2022/08/Clean-and-Sober-Home-Registry-Standards-Checklist.pdf) contains the complete list of requirements. There is also a powerpoint presentation of an orientation designed for people looking to add their sober living home to Hawaii’s Clean and Sober Homes Registry [available online](../../../../../health.hawaii.gov/substance-abuse/files/2019/03/CLEAN-SOBER-HOMES-REGISTRY-Orientation.pdf). 

## How much does it cost to be entered into the Clean and Sober Home Registry?

Believe it or not, entry into the registry is free. There are no application fees, inspection fees or ongoing annual fees associated with participation in the Clean and Sober Home Registry. 

## Does my Hawaii sober living home have to be entered into the registry in order to receive referrals from state agencies?

No. Unlike other states, Hawaii does not restrict state referrals to homes listed on the registry. Instead, the bill is intended to indicate a “preference” for these homes within state referral sources. In other words, parole officers, social workers and other workers are supposed to refer to sober living homes listed on the registry first. It’s difficult to say whether this happens in reality. 

## What are some of the downsides of operating a sober living home in Hawaii?

The high price of real estate in Hawaii makes sober living homes difficult to maintain, especially when they are operated on a rental arbitrage model. Many homes, like [Laukapu House on the big island](https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/04/an-important-big-island-clean-and-sober-house-is-forced-to-close/), have been forced to close when the owners have decided to sell the property in response to sharp increases in value. 

## What is the difference between sober living homes, recovery residences, and “clean & sober homes” in Hawaii? 

While any sober facility is Hawaii can call itself a “recovery residence” or a “sober living home” only homes that have been added to the state’s Clean and Sober Homes Registry can refer to itself as a “clean and sober home.”

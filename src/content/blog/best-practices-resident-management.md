# Best Practices for Resident Management in Sober Living Facilities

Managing residents in a sober living facility requires a delicate balance of structure, support, and respect for individual autonomy. Effective resident management is crucial for maintaining a safe, therapeutic environment that promotes long-term recovery success.

## Establishing Clear Expectations from Day One

### Comprehensive Intake Process

The foundation of successful resident management begins with a thorough intake process:

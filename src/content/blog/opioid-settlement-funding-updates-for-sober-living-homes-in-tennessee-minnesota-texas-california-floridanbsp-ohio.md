## Tennessee Began Processing Sober Living Home Funding from Opioid Settlement Money in February 2023 

Tennessee received a total of $31.4 million in opioid lawsuit settlement money. The Tennessee Opioid Abatement Council has been charged with disbursing the money. Payments [began processing in February 2023](https://www.tn.gov/behavioral-health/news/2023/2/24/tennessee-s-opioid-abatement-council-announces-first-round-of-direct-payments-to-county-governments.html). 35% of the money will go directly to county governments so that it can be controlled and supervised locally. The remaining money will be granted to organizations based on a competitive grant application process.

In a selected activities list developed by the Opioid Abatement Council, sober living homes and recovery housing are named as eligible entities for receiving opioid settlement money and grants. The list stipulates that this recovery housing must allow MAT medications and “allow or integrate other support services,” as well. 

To apply, visit the [Opioid Abatement Council website](https://www.tn.gov/oac/our-work.html) and see if the portal to apply is currently open. As of this writing, it is closed, but it is expected to re-open in the 3rd quarter of 2024. 

## Minnesota Approves Treatment, Prevention and Harm Reduction for Opioid Settlement Money Funding 

![minnesota recovery residence grant funding opioid settlement news](/images/blog/opioid-settlement-funding-updates-for-sober-living-homes-in-tennessee-minnesota-texas-california-floridanbsp-ohio/Screen_Shot_2024-03-10_at_6.21.56_PM.png)

Minnesota will receive settlement money in [excess of $300 million](https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/opioids/settlefunds.html) over the next 18 years. 75% of this money is controlled by individual counties and cities, while 25% of it is controlled by the state itself. There is no centralized place to apply for funding for sober living in Minnesota, you’ll need to locate the funding application at whatever city or county you intend to provide services. For example, Ramsey County hosts an [information page on Opioid Response Community Grants](https://www.ramseycounty.us/businesses/doing-business-ramsey-county/opioid-response-community-grants) where applications and other information can be found regarding sober living home funding possibilities through opioid settlement grants. 

Treatment, prevention and harm reduction are all funded categories under Minnesota opioid settlement grant programs. 

## Texas Will Begin Disbursing Opioid Settlement Funding to Sober Living Homes in 2024

Texas was [awarded roughly $1.6 billion](https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/archive/2023/jan/opioid.php) in opioid settlement money, which will trickle into the state over the course of the next 18 years. The state’s opioid settlement money is controlled by a central agency, the [Texas Opioid Abatement Fund Council](https://comptroller.texas.gov/programs/opioid-council/). Although the Council originally stated that they intended to begin disbursements in early 2023, as of this writing, the Council is targeting FY 2024 for the first wave of applications, although they note that even that eventuality is “subjected to change.” 

White it is not currently possible to apply for sober living home grants drawing from opioid settlement money in Texas, you can submit an [“Intent to Apply” form](https://txcomptroller.my.site.com/OPDVendorInquiryIntake/s/) to notify the state of your intentions, when the application process opens. You can also apply for [email updates](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/TXCOMPT/subscriber/new?topic_id=TXCOMPT_1664) from the Council, to notify you of updates and timelines for the first wave of funding applications. 

## California Disburses Sober Living Home Funding from Opioid Settlement Money from a Centralized Fund

California is depositing all opioid settlement money into a [centralized fund](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/Pages/California-Opioid-Settlements.aspx), called the “Opioids Settlements Fund,” that is overseen by the Department of Health Care Services. From there, the money is disbursed to beneficiaries directly by the California state legislature through standard budgetary activity. 

80% of the funds will be disbursed to city and county governments in California.

There are not currently any [funding opportunities](https://californiaopioidresponse.org/opportunities/current-funding-opportunities/) accepting applications on the California Opioid Response website. There are many currently funded [city, county](https://californiaopioidresponse.org/opioid-settlements/city-and-county-projects/), and [state](https://californiaopioidresponse.org/opioid-settlements/state-funded-projects/) funded projects afoot in California that are making use of the state’s opioid settlement money. 

## Florida Began Disbursing Sober Living Home Funding from Opioid Settlement Money in 2023

Florida began distributing opioid settlement money last year. It [amounts to $205.7 million](https://www.myflfamilies.com/opioid-settlement#:~:text=Opioid%20Settlement%20Funds,FY%2023%2D24%20Florida%20budget.) \- and that’s only in year one of many years of funding that the state will eventually receive through the settlements. The state controls the money with the state budget, but it has a unique 3-prong distribution system from there. [Tampa Bay](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/07/24/florida-is-getting-opioid-settlement-money-heres-how-itll-be-spent/) has an excellent article detailing exactly how this system works, and why. 

The state controls some of the money, counties will control another part of the money in a regional fund, and, finally, a third pool of money is set aside for direct aid to individual cities and counties which sought their own settlements.

Although the state created a Statewide Council on Opioid Abatement, that entity will only monitor spending and act in an advisory capacity to governments about spending strategies that will be most impactful.

Ohio’s [rollout of a viable grant distribution program](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/ohio-foundation-begins-process-to-distribute-over-860-million-in-opioid-settlement-money) for [opioid settlement money](https://ohiosettlement.org/) just began earlier this month in March 2024. Over $1 billion will ultimately be distributed by the state, with $860 million to be distributed by the [Ohio Opioid Settlement Project](https://www.oneohiofoundation.com/), created by Harm Reduction Ohio. 

The [grant headquarters page](https://www.oneohiofoundation.com/grants) on the Ohio Opioid Settlement Project website is highly informative about the application process that has just opened for organizations seeking opioid settlement-backed funding. Grant registration opened March 4th, Applications will open April 2nd, and submissions are due May 3rd. You can access the OneOhio Grant Portal [here](https://goapply2.akoyago.com/ONEOHIO/Identity/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2FONEOHIO%2Fapplication%2FOrgRegistration).

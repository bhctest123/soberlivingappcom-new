## Are sober living homes required to be certified or licensed in Maine? 

No. Although there is a NARR affiliate in Maine, MARR - or the Maine Alliance of Recovery Residences - the government does not require sober living homes to seek certification through them in order to operate in the state. 

However, a law was recently passed in Maine that states that if sober living homes will collect public housing dollars of any kind, or seek any assistance from the government, then they must seek certification through MARR. 

Otherwise, sober living homes in Maine must follow all of the same regulations as single family homes, namely fire codes and general building safety codes.

## Do sober living homes have to supply Narcan in Maine?

Yes. Maine recently [passed a law](https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/bills_129th/billtexts/HP022701.asp) that states that all sober living homes that cater to individuals with substance use disorder must keep Narcan (also called Naloxone) on hand in case of an overdose emergency. 

## Are there grants for opening sober living homes in Maine?

Yes. One sober living home operator was awarded “more than 1,000,000 in Federal HUD grants” to purchase their sober living home, according to [this news article](https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/health/bridgtons-first-recovery-home-to-open-soon-substance-abuse-awareness-treatment-center-maine/97-5216fbc6-847a-4b33-87d1-73b7aca0ab5f). 

Although Maine’s Recovery Residence Pilot Program has long since closed the application window, there are other funding streams available for sober living home operators in the state. For example, the Governor announced in 2022 that the rural areas of Maine would receive [over 1.9 million dollars in behavioral health care funding](https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/index.php/news/radio_address/governor-mills-expanding-substance-use-disorder-treatment-rural-maine-2022-09-16) for “start-up costs, like staff training and development” in order to reach these underserved areas.

## Does Maine have enough sober living homes? What is the demand for sober living like in Maine? 

![sober living home demand business plan maine recovery residence](/images/blog/faq-about-how-to-open-an-sober-living-home-in-maine/Screen_Shot_2023-01-15_at_5.05.08_PM.png)

No. Maine is sorely lacking in recovery residences. Both the [University of Maine](https://mainedrugdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2022-06-Drug-Death-Report-final-Aug-5.pdf) and the [Rural Drug and Alcohol Research Program](https://mcspolicycenter.umaine.edu/rural-drug-and-alcohol-research/) found that overdose fatalities have been on the rise in Maine in the last few years. Each of these reports indicates that the lack of services and infrastructure to support the recovery community play a large part in the rise of SUD related deaths in the state. 

## Who is the NARR affiliate in Maine? Who oversees the accreditation process for sober living homes in the state? 

![NARR MARR Maine sober living home advocacy certification regulation](/images/blog/faq-about-how-to-open-an-sober-living-home-in-maine/Screen_Shot_2023-01-15_at_4.29.13_PM.png)

The [National Association of Recovery Residences](https://narronline.org/) is locally represented by [MARR, the Maine Association of Recovery Residences](https://www.mainerecoveryresidences.com/). MARR was founded in 2016 and is the only accrediting body that is entrusted with the responsibility of managing the ongoing certification of recovery residences in the state. 

In addition to advocating for the sober living community in Maine, MARR has also begun [collecting outcomes data](https://www.mainerecoveryresidences.com/blog/6jszpe8vjjmtajsv3c0m9n93txj2aj) on its members in order to generate more evidence to support the promotion of recovery residences in the state. This work should impact the level of acceptance sober living enjoys in the community, as well as the amount of resources allocated to sober living at the state level.  

## What is the process for getting a sober living home certified in Maine? 

![opening a sober living home in Maine with MARR certification](/images/blog/faq-about-how-to-open-an-sober-living-home-in-maine/Screen_Shot_2023-01-15_at_4.29.35_PM.png)

You can complete a [form on the MARR website](https://www.mainerecoveryresidences.com/apply-for-certification) to begin the certification process. You’ll also need to submit a $50 application fee as well as an annual fee of $250 plus a per-bed fee of $1 for each bed in your facility. If you own multiple homes, then you’ll also owe an additional $100 each year for every additional house you manage. The per-bed fee will also apply to the beds in this second (or third, etc) residence.

## What are the benefits of getting my sober living home certified by MARR in Maine? 

There are several benefits to certification. For one, MARR certified sober living homes may accept government housing dollars, while other homes may not. Furthermore, your certification gives you access to valuable networking and advocacy opportunities that you otherwise would not have. All sober living homes that receive MARR certification are featured on the MARR website, as well, which many professionals use for referrals. This helps generate “free publicity” for your home. Finally, MARR certification helps prove your organization’s credibility to the community, possibly off-setting any NIMBY resistance to your organization at the neighborhood level.

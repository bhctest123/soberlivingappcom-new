While addiction treatment centers in Kansas must be certified in order to operate, there are no such laws regarding sober living homes - also known as halfway houses and recovery residences - in the state. Furthermore, there is no NARR affiliate in Kansas to oversee NARR standards or issue certifications based on NARR requirements. Despite the overall lack of regulation in the state, there are, nonetheless, many active NIMBY contingents throughout the state that try - and often fail - to put pressure on sober living home operators to relocate or shutter homes that are placed in residential areas. 

Today, we’ll look at what makes Kansas a great state to open a sober living home and go into the details of what makes this state an easy one to operate in for recovery residence owners. 

## Kansas Has No Certification or Licensing Requirements for Sober Living Homes 

![are sober living homes required to get certification in Kansas](/images/blog/kansas-is-a-great-state-to-open-a-sober-living-home/Screen_Shot_2023-01-03_at_5.17.10_PM.png)

Because sober living homes are in a completely separate category from addiction treatment centers, they are exempt from the bulk of state [oversight requirements](https://kdads.ks.gov/docs/librariesprovider17/survey-certification-and-credentialing-commission/behavioral-health-licensing/sud-facilities/standards.pdf?sfvrsn=51439ee_2) that addiction treatment centers must consider in Kansas. Addiction treatment centers must be certified in Kansas in order to do business. 

The Secretary of Social and Rehabilitation Services oversees the certification of addiction treatment centers in Kansas, but there is no corresponding regulatory body that oversees sober living in the state because no such certification program exists.   

## There is a Strong Network of Oxford Homes in Kansas - And They Have Their Own Advocacy Organization 

![Oxford Homes sober living Kansas FORA Friends of Recovery Association regulation advocacy](/images/blog/kansas-is-a-great-state-to-open-a-sober-living-home/Screen_Shot_2023-01-03_at_6.09.41_PM.png)

If you intend on opening a for-profit sober living home, then you may be tempted to think that this section doesn’t apply to you. However, even if you do not intend to open an [Oxford Home](https://oxfordhouse.org/) \- a type of democratically run, non-profit sober living home - it is worth knowing about the format and understanding how extensively this model is implemented throughout the state. There are 156 Oxford Homes, and counting, in Kansas. These homes find a fierce advocate in the [Friends of Recovery Association](https://www.friendsofrecovery.com/). This organization does fundraisers and other advocacy work for the Oxford model in the state of Kansas. 

Friend of Recovery Association also maintains a [handy list and map](https://www.friendsofrecovery.com/oxford_houses) of all of the Oxford Homes in the state, which may be useful for the market research phase of any sober living home development project. 

Friends of Recovery Association also has its own criteria for appropriate Oxford Homes that is shared on its website. 

The criteria is as follows: 

  * “Good” neighborhood 

  * Accommodate a minimum of 6 residents 

  * At Least 4 bedrooms 

  * At Least 2 bathrooms 

## There is a Strong Undercurrent of NIMBYism Facing Kansas Sober Living Homes

Although sober living homes in Kansas are protected by the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, neighbors, city councils, housing associations and other municipal organizations often cater to stigma and attempt to limit the presence of sober living homes in their communities. 

For example, one sober living home in Overland Park, a subdivision of Shannon Valley, received pushback from neighbors, triggering a [city council tiff](https://shawneemissionpost.com/2022/01/12/shannon-valley-sober-living-facility-139509/) and a scuffle with the homeowners association. Ultimately, city officials confirmed that the home was protected under federal law and must be allowed to operate without any extra permits or hearings. 

## There is No National Association of Recovery Residences Affiliate in Kansas

![there is no NARR affiliate in Kansas sober living home recovery residence](/images/blog/kansas-is-a-great-state-to-open-a-sober-living-home/Screen_Shot_2023-01-03_at_6.10.16_PM.png)

Though most states have a NARR affiliate that is either pre-existing or in the process of forming, Kansas is among the handful of states that has no emerging affiliate at this time. As NARR affiliates continue to open up in more and more states in the nation, it seems likely that Kansas will soon be home to a NARR affiliate but according to the [NARR website](https://narronline.org/?location=mo), that time has not yet come.

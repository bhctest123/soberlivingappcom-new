Looking to open a sober living home or recovery residence in Arizona? Here’s 5 tips for getting the job done as quickly and painlessly as possible.

## Review the Arizona Sober Living Home Fact Sheet

The [Arizona Department of Health Services Sober Living Home Fact Sheet](<https://www.azdhs.gov/documents/licensing/special/sober-living-homes/sober-living-fact-sheet.pdf>) is perhaps the most useful and concise document we’ve ever seen produced by a state government agency for would-be sober living home owners. The fact sheet covers all of the pertinent laws as well as the relevant contact information for all licensing agencies all in one easy-to-digest guide. 

Sober living home operation does not get more straightforward than this!

## Understand that Arizona Began Requiring Licensing for Sober Living Homes in 2019

In 2018, the Arizona legislature passed a law requiring all sober living homes to obtain licensing through the state. In 2019, those laws went into effect. 

Specifically, ARS 26-2061(3) defines sober living homes - homes that must be licensed by the state - as facilities that: 

> a) Promotes independent living and life skills development. 
> 
> b) May provide activities that are directed primarily toward recovery from substance use disorders. 
> 
> c) Provides a supervised setting to a group of unrelated individuals who are recovering from substance use disorders. 
> 
> d) Does not provide any medical or clinical services or medication administration on-site, except for verification of abstinence.

This means that all homes, even Oxford model homes and religiously-affiliated homes, must seek licensing in the state of Arizona. 

## Complete the Seven Page Licensing Application for Arizona Sober Living Homes

You can easily access the full application online [here](<https://www.azdhs.gov/documents/licensing/special/sober-living-homes/sober-living-complete-application.pdf?v=20220705>). If your home is already certified by a recognized body, you won’t have to complete the physical inspection phase of licensing. However, all applications must include: 

  * Attestation regarding zoning compliance 

  * Attestation regarding building codes 

  * Attestation regarding fire codes 

  * Statement of Citizenship or Alien Status form for the person taking responsibility for the application 

  * Copy of citizenship for the person taking responsibility for the application 

  * A floor plan of the home, with the location and size of all rooms marked

  * A statement from the owner of the home (if it’s a rental) stating authorizing use of the home as a sober living facility 

  * A cashiers check or money order for the licensing fees made out to the Arizona Department of Health Services 

While this list does look substantial, it is actually on the less onerous end of possible requirements various states place on sober living home licensing applications. The fact that Arizona accepts simple attestations with a signature of the applicant stating that the home is in compliance with zoning rules, building codes and fire codes is a huge time-saver. Many states require documentation and notarized statements from the relevant agencies proving that these conditions are being met before they will OK licensing. Arizona just takes your word for it. 

## Understand that Sober Living Homes in Phoenix Arizona are Also Subject to City Rules About Community Residences

When you’re thinking of opening a sober living home, it’s always smart to double-check for any existing regulations, not only at the state level, but at the county and city level as well. If, for example, you’re considering siting your home in Phoenix, AZ, you’ll need to take the city’s “[community residence](<https://www.phoenix.gov/pdd/group-homes-community-residences>)” rules into consideration. In Phoenix, state licensing is not enough. You’ll also have to submit a [registration form for a community residence home](<https://www.phoenix.gov/pddsite/Documents/PZ/pdd_pz_pdf_00462.pdf>), assuming your home will house between six and ten people at any given time. If your home is very large and you expect to house over 10 residents, you’ll need to complete a [registration form for community residence centers](<https://www.phoenix.gov/pddsite/Documents/PZ/pdd_pz_pdf_00463.pdf>).

For either type of sober living facility within city limits, you must allow residents to stay for a minimum of one month, assuming they follow all house rules. You’ll owe the city $250 for “zoning certification” while they process your application.

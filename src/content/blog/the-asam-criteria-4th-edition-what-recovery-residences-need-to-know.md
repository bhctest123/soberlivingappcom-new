Recovery residences are an essential part of the addiction treatment continuum, providing a supportive social milieu and/or supportive housing for individuals in recovery. The ASAM Criteria, 4th Edition is a comprehensive set of guidelines for placement, continued stay, transfer, or discharge of patients with addiction and co-occurring conditions. [The ASAM Criteria, 4th Edition](https://www.asam.org/asam-criteria/4th-edition-development) recognizes the importance of recovery residences in supporting individuals in their recovery journey. For many patients, the need for recovery supportive housing with a supportive social milieu and/or supportive housing may extend past the need for residential treatment.

The [ASAM 4th edition changes have a significant impact on recovery residences](https://newasamcriteria.org/). The changes in the ASAM 4th edition impact the delivery of care in recovery residences. Recovery residences need to comply with the ASAM 4th edition changes to provide quality care to their residents.

One way recovery residences can comply with the ASAM 4th edition changes is by implementing EHR software. EHR software is a digital record-keeping system that can help recovery residences comply with the ASAM 4th edition changes. EHR software can improve the quality of care provided in recovery residences by providing accurate and up-to-date information about residents' treatment plans, progress, and outcomes. Recovery residences can use EHR software to track residents' progress and ensure that they are receiving the appropriate level of care.[ Behave Health Corp, a healthcare software company that sells EHR, CRM, RCM all-in-one software to providers that deliver substance use disorder and mental health treatment services, offers EHR software with insurance billing capabilities built for recovery residences](https://behavehealth.com). [Sober Living App is another EHR software](../../../../index.html) with insurance billing capabilities built for recovery residences.

Another way recovery residences can comply with the ASAM 4th edition changes is by implementing insurance billing capabilities. Insurance billing capabilities are essential for recovery residences to receive reimbursement for the services they provide. Recovery residences need to be able to bill insurance companies for the services they provide to their residents. Insurance billing capabilities can help recovery residences comply with the ASAM 4th edition changes by ensuring that they are receiving the appropriate reimbursement for the services they provide. Behave Health Corp and Sober Living App are examples of EHR software with insurance billing capabilities built for recovery residences.

The use of EHR software and insurance billing capabilities can improve the overall quality of care provided in recovery residences. Recovery residences that have successfully implemented EHR software and insurance billing capabilities have seen improvements in the accuracy and completeness of their records, as well as increased reimbursement for the services they provide. However, recovery residences may face challenges when implementing EHR software and insurance billing capabilities, such as the cost of implementation and training staff to use the software.

In conclusion, recovery residences play a critical role in supporting individuals in their recovery journey. The ASAM 4th edition changes have a significant impact on recovery residences, and recovery residences need to comply with these changes to provide quality care to their residents. EHR software and insurance billing capabilities are essential tools that recovery residences can use to comply with the ASAM 4th edition changes and improve the quality of care provided. Recovery residences should consider implementing EHR software and insurance billing capabilities, such as Behave Health Corp and Sober Living App, to improve the quality of care provided to their residents.

What’s the [admissions process](/admission) like at your sober living home? 

Organized? Disorganized? A file full of multicolored papers that need to be signed? A clunky mixture of paper and electronic documents?

When was the last time you updated your admissions system? 

The admissions process at your sober living home establishes your residents’ first impression of your organization. As the first link in a long chain of documentation, it ultimately sets your sober living home’s operation up for success—or failure. 

Perfecting your admissions process ensures a smooth introduction to your sober living home, reduces the stress of the transition for residents, and establishes a frictionless working relationship between residents and management. 

Today, let’s look at the four best tips for refining the admissions process at your sober living home. 

## Make Applying Easy

Lowering barriers for application to your sober living home starts with making access to the actual application easy. [The Sober Living App](/admission)’s admissions application webform puts your sober living home admissions application on the phones and computers of prospective residents instantly, at any time of day. Prospective residents don’t need to wait to place a call, make an appointment, or receive an application in the mail—they can act on their impulse to apply when it’s on the top of their mind. 

## Oil Your Lead Generation Pipeline

Your sober living home likely has many conversations with prospective residents—some resulting in an admission and many leading nowhere. In order to keep beds full, it’s important to cast a wide net and maintain contact continuity with all potential leads. The best way to do this is using a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. 

A [good CRM designed for sober living homes](https://soberlivingapp.com/sober-living-app-blog/2019/6/12/whyd4uddqueuvptcntx0w73kfku109) makes it simple to track all of the information you gather about each lead so that each conversation can build on the next and no potential resident is forced to repeat themselves unnecessarily. Having data about all of your potential residents organized in a CRM makes it easy to prioritize followup with leads who have the highest likelihood of admission. 

## Move Upfront Fee Collection Online 

![Collecting upfront fees online is a no-brainer.](/images/blog/mastering-admissions-at-your-sober-living-home/wallet.png)

If your sober living home isn’t collecting any upfront fees during the admissions process, now is the time to start. Collecting fees upfront helps reduce your financial risk with each admission. 

The Sober Living App’s online payment processor puts residents in the driver’s seat of the billing process. The process begins with online upfront fee collection and includes an integrated billing solution that generates automatic online invoices for rent payments. The Sober Living App makes it easy to collect payment from residents and/or their family members no matter where they are located. 

## Track Referral Sources

Referral source tracking is a commonly overlooked part of the admissions process.

If you don’t know where your existing residents are coming from, it is impossible to know how to improve your referral network. 

Collecting data on where your residents are coming from enables you to quantify the value of each of your referral partnerships so that you can strategically prioritize those relationships. 

The Sober Living App’s CRM automatically collects data on referral channels during the admissions process so that your [house manager](https://soberlivingapp.com/sober-living-app-blog/2020/3/3/5-things-all-of-the-best-sober-living-home-managers-have-in-common) has one less thing to remember during intakes.

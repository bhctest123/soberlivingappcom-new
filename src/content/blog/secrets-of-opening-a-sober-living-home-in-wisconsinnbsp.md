## Sober Living Home Operators Should Note That Wisconsin’s Top Addictions Are Alcohol, Opioids and Meth

According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Wisconsin natives have [higher rates of alcohol misuse](<https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/alcohol/adult-use.htm>) than other Americans and they are falling victim to drug overdose deaths at [ever increasing rates](<https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/aoda/drug-overdose-deaths.htm>) as fentanyl and other opioids become more prevalent in the community. Methamphetamine use has also seen a steep increase in the state, with a [whopping 450% increase](<https://wisconsinwatch.org/2019/10/while-millions-are-spent-to-fight-the-opioid-epidemic-a-meth-crisis-quietly-grows-in-wisconsin/>) in use recorded in Wisconsin in 2019. 

## The Recovery Residence Registry List Maintained by the State of Wisconsin Can Help With Sober Living Home Market Research

The state of Wiscsonsin maintains a [Recovery Residence Registry list](<https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/guide/recovresdir.pdf>), which can be very helpful during the market research phase of your sober living home development project. The list is organized by county and lists the operator's name, contact information, zip code, registration date, and the maximum number of residents allowed in the home. It also specifies if the home accepts residents who opt for medication assisted treatment. You can use this list to get a better understanding of the existing marketplace for recovery residences in Wisconsin. This can help you identify holes in the market and assist in developing a successful business plan in terms of location and population served. 

## You Do Not Need to Register Your Sober Living Home With the State in Wisconsin Unless You Want to Accept State Funding For Your Program

Registration with the state is optional in Wisconsin, however, the state is [actively seeking](<https://www.wispolitics.com/2021/dept-of-health-services-health-agency-seeking-more-applicants-for-recovery-residence-registry-for-people-with-substance-use-disorders>) more sober living homes to register under the Recovery Residence Registry. In order to be considered for state-based referrals - for example, from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services - all sober living homes must register with the state. The rules for registration are laid out in the Wisconsin Stat. [**46.234: Recovery residences; registration.**](<https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/46/234>)**The statute states that the state may omit sober living homes that do not accept residents who opt for medication assisted treatment from the registry.**

The rules for “state approved” sober living homes in WIsconsin are minimal. You must: 

  * “Operate with integrity, uphold residents' rights, create a culture of empowerment where residents engage in governance and leadership, and develop abilities to apply the social model form of recovery that focuses on learning from the experiences of peers who are also in recovery.”

  * Maintain a “home-like” and safe living environment 

  * Disallow drugs and alcohol from the premises

  * Establish and uphold “courtesy” and good neighbor rules 

  * Display a code of ethics, presumably on a wall of the residence

  * Develop a “grievance procedure” and provide “grievance contact information”

You can access the application for Recovery Residence Registry [here](<https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/forms/f02706.docx>). 

## Take Your Wisconsin Sober Living Home s Step Further With Certification by WASH - Wisconsin Association of Sober Living

You can find information about how to get your optional WASH certification [here](<https://washcommunity.org/home-1>). This NARR affiliate upholds quality norms that are in keeping with national gold standards established by the National Association of Recovery Residences. Members benefit from advocacy and lobbying representation as well as education and training about best practices. 

## There are Some State Funding and Grant Programs Available for Sober Living Home Operators in Wisconsin

Wisconsin just announced in 2022 a new [recovery housing voucher initiative](<https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/regulations/aoda/recovery-housing-flyer20220824.pdf>) which helps cover rent for those at risk of homelessness. This program allocates $2 million dollars for recovery residences to cover the cost of housing people in recovery. The maxim allowed benefit to agencies and organizations with a sober living home is $100,000 per year. There are other funds available for sober living homes in Wisconsin, too. [Women-focused sober living home businesses](<https://www.weau.com/2021/01/08/sober-living-community-for-women-opens-in-eau-claire/>) may find [Red Letter Grants](<https://www.redlettergrant.org/our-vision>) of particular interest. 

## Do Not Confuse Wisconsin Sober Living Homes With Peer Run Respite Homes 

Sober living homes in Wisconsin are not to be confused with [peer run respite homes](<https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/peer-services/peer-run-respites.htm>) in the state. At peer run respite homes, those experiencing mental health and addiction crises may stay for up to seven days in a supportive, yet non-clinical, setting with no restrictions on visitors, outings or meetings. The program is somewhat unique to Wisconsin and is only available in a few select locations.

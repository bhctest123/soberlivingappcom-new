# Sober Living Management Software: Complete Guide 2024

![Sober living management software comparison and guide for recovery housing operators](/images/blog/sober-living-management-software-complete-guide-2024/hero.png)

Managing a sober living home without the right software is like running a hospital with paper charts. You'll spend 60% of your time on administrative tasks instead of focusing on resident care and business growth.

Recovery housing operators using comprehensive management software report 40% revenue increases and 60% reductions in administrative time. But with dozens of options available, choosing the right platform can feel overwhelming.

This complete guide analyzes every major sober living management software option in 2024, comparing features, pricing, and real-world performance to help you make the best decision for your facility.

## What is Sober Living Management Software?

Sober living management software is a specialized platform designed to automate the administrative, financial, and operational aspects of running recovery residences. Unlike generic CRM or property management systems, these platforms are built specifically for the unique needs of sober living homes, halfway houses, and transitional housing programs.

### Core Functions of Sober Living Software

**Resident Management**
- Intake and admission processing
- Bed assignment and housing coordination
- Resident agreements and documentation
- Progress tracking and case notes

**Financial Operations**
- Automated billing and rent collection
- Insurance processing and claims
- Payment plan management
- Financial reporting and analytics

**Compliance and Safety**
- Drug testing scheduling and results tracking
- NARR standards compliance monitoring
- State certification requirement tracking
- Incident reporting and documentation

**Operations Management**
- Staff scheduling and task management
- Maintenance request tracking
- Communication logs and messaging
- Alumni and referral management

### Why Generic Software Doesn't Work

Many operators try to save money using generic CRM systems like Salesforce or property management platforms like AppFolio. This approach consistently fails because:

- **Missing compliance features**: Generic platforms lack drug testing, NARR standards tracking, and recovery-specific reporting
- **Complex billing needs**: Recovery housing billing involves insurance coordination, payment plans, and specialized invoicing requirements
- **Staff workflow mismatch**: Generic systems aren't designed for house managers, recovery coaches, and peer support staff
- **Regulatory gaps**: Lack of built-in HIPAA compliance and 42 CFR Part 2 protections

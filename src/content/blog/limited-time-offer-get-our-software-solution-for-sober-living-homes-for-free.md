We are thrilled to announce the release of our brand new FREE accounts for [Sober Living App](/). 

Yes, you heard that right: We are giving away our best-in-class, lightning quick, super intuitive software designed especially for Sober Living Homes absolutely free! 

This is a limited time offer. Read on to learn more about why we’re doing this and what you’ll get with your free account or just [claim your free account](https://apps.behavehealth.com/signup) before we come to our senses reach capacity. 

## Get Everything You Need to Run your Sober Living Home in One Easy-To-Use App With Plans Starting as Low as $0

![Sober Living App all-in-one software solution for sober living home operators has plans starting at $0. Let your software grow with your organization as you add more beds, more homes and more services.](/images/blog/limited-time-offer-get-our-software-solution-for-sober-living-homes-for-free/Screenshot_2021-01-19_at_7.16.23_AM.png)

You get what you pay for, right? 

Most of the time, yes. 

In this case - no, we actually want to give your organization quite a bit of value for zero dollars. 

Sure, our free accounts are no substitute for our more fully-featured options for sober living home operators —  like our Basic, Plus and Pro accounts —  but they pack a punch nonetheless. 

In each free HIPAA-ready Sober Living App account, you can expect: 

  * Client Database

  * Bed Management Tool

  * Admissions Center 

  * Property Management Tools 

  * Employee Database

  * Smart Phone Ready Staff/iOS/Android Apps

  * Permissions 

  * RCM - Consumer 

  * Behave Chat

## Sober Living App’s Free Accounts are Small but Mighty - and Ready to Grow With Your Business

“This sounds great,” you might be thinking, “but can it scale?”

Why, yes. Yes it can. 

With four different provider categories and 3 paid tiers of service to choose from, we have created plans that perfectly suit nearly every player in the addiction treatment community. 

If you find that you want to expand from sober living home management into treatment, we’ve got a plan for that. 

Adding a boutique private practice clinic to your suite of investments? Want to share your software solution with your buddy who does online recovery coaching? 

Our software has plans designed for each of these settings and more.

## Sober Living App: Software for the Future We Want 

![Sober Living App isn’t just for the big players. We have plans for everyone from independent behavioral health techs and clinicians to recovery coaches, too. Everyone has a right to the tools we offer.](/images/blog/limited-time-offer-get-our-software-solution-for-sober-living-homes-for-free/Screenshot_2021-01-21_at_8.58.18_PM.png)

One of the things we’re most proud of at [Behave Health](https://behavehealth.com/) and the Sober Living App is our commitment to making this game-changing software accessible for everyone in the addiction treatment community. 

Too many software developers in this space only design for major corporate treatment centers to the exclusion of everyone else. 

At Behave Health and the Sober Living App, we firmly believe that everyone deserves to have the tools they need to get this important job done. That’s why we offer extremely affordable micro plans for small treatment providers, clinics and centers alongside our competitive plans for regional and national organizations. 

In addition to special deals for small business, we offer aggressive volume discounting for larger players, as well as a generous referral rewards program. We also have special pricing for nonprofits. 

## Need An EHR? Need HIPAA-Compliant Software? Sober Living App Might Not Be Right For You - But We Can Still Help  

All of Sober Living App’s plans - including the free plan - don’t include an EHR or full HIPAA compliant BAAs. If you find that you’re needing more from your software, consider Behave Health’s [Healthcare Facility Plans](https://behavehealth.com/healthcare-facility) instead.

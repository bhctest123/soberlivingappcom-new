      <p>As your organization grows, managing who can access what becomes increasingly complex. Our permission system provides the flexibility to create sophisticated access controls while maintaining simplicity for administrators.</p>
      
      <h3>Common Permission Scenarios</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shift-Based Access:</strong> Night staff see only essential information</li>
        <li><strong>Department Isolation:</strong> Billing staff access financial data only</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Access:</strong> Contractors get time-limited permissions</li>
        <li><strong>Hierarchy Support:</strong> Supervisors see their team's data</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Limit access to sensitive resident information</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Compliance and Security</h3>
      <p>Meet HIPAA, state regulations, and industry best practices with permission controls that ensure data access is limited to those with legitimate need. Complete audit trails demonstrate compliance during reviews.</p>

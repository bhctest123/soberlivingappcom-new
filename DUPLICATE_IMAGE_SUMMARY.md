# Duplicate Image Audit Summary

## Overview
- **Total Blog Posts**: 156
- **Total Unique Images**: 433
- **Images Used Multiple Times**: 78 (18% of all images)
- **Posts Affected**: 78 posts have duplicate images

## Key Findings

### 1. Most Problematic Duplicates
These images appear multiple times within the same post (self-duplication):

1. **the-asam-criteria-4th-edition-what-recovery-residences-need-to-know.md**
   - Uses the same image 3 times: `/images/blog/the-asam-criteria-4th-edition-what-recovery-residences-need-to-know/image-asset.jpeg`
   - Featured image (line 9), then repeated in content (lines 27, 37)

2. **mastering-admissions-at-your-sober-living-home.md**
   - Uses `wallet.png` twice (featured image and line 57)

3. **what-is-a-sober-living-home.md**
   - Uses `image-asset.jpeg` twice (featured image and line 29)

### 2. Generic/Stock Images Used Across Posts
These generic images should be replaced with unique, post-specific images:

- `wallet.png` - Used in multiple unrelated posts
- `life-862985_1280.jpg` - Generic stock photo
- `runners_in_a_race.png` - Used in different contexts
- `hero.png` - Used for multiple software guide posts

### 3. Screenshot Naming Issues
Many posts use generic screenshot names that don't describe content:
- `Screen_Shot_2023-01-10_at_3.58.46_PM.png`
- `Screenshot_2020-10-29_at_12.40.02_PM.png`
- `image-asset.jpeg`

## Priority Actions

### High Priority (SEO Impact)
1. **Software Guide Posts** - All use identical `hero.png`:
   - halfway-house-management-software-guide.md
   - sober-living-management-software-complete-guide-2024.md
   - recovery-housing-software-guide-2024.md
   - transitional-housing-software-complete-guide.md

2. **State-Specific Opening Guides** - Many use duplicate screenshots:
   - Need unique featured images for each state guide
   - Currently using generic screenshots with timestamps

### Medium Priority
1. **Self-Duplicating Posts** - Posts that use the same image multiple times:
   - Remove duplicate instances within posts
   - Keep only the featured image unless different images are needed

2. **Generic Images** - Replace with specific images:
   - wallet.png → finance/payment specific images
   - runners_in_a_race.png → competition/market specific images
   - life-*.jpg → recovery/sober living specific images

### Low Priority
1. **Screenshot Renaming** - While not affecting SEO directly:
   - Rename to descriptive filenames
   - Include post topic in filename
